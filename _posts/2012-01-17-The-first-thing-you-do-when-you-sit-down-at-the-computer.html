It made me think, which people does this apply to in the software industry?</p><p>On the long term this attitude leads to a state of mind where you are used to be driven by your own decisions and not (directly) driven by the incoming &quot;pokings&quot; of your environment.</p><p>Who can benefit from such state of mind?&#0160;</p><p>I think everyone.</p><p>Us, coders. As the <strong>code</strong> we are developing <strong><a href="http://xp.c2.com/TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html" target="_blank">is the design itself</a>&#0160;</strong>we are designers who have to have independent, creative thinking.
