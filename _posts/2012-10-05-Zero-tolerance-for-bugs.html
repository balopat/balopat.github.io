<p>The vision of creating something awesome is shared in all our minds. A system that is a breeze to work with, new joiners pick it up instantly and understand business from the code. A reliable set of features where QAs hardly find errors. An understanding, enlightened culture valueing true quality over buggy but on-time delivery.</p><br /><p><em>But the time pressure?!  Our deadlines are too tight! What is more important?...please prioritize for me!! We don&#39;t know the requirements!! They tell me it&#39;s ok to have something rather than nothing!</em></p><br /><p>True. It&#39;s hard. But it is also our responsibility as professionals taking pride in our work to protect quality in all cases. </p><br /><p><em>But I lose my job if I don&#39;t finish. My boss will be in trouble if I say 5 weeks of estimate instead of 2 weeks. My BA is pushing my estimates down! It will take me 3 hours to do it properly instead of 3 minutes to just make it work. They won&#39;t understand I wouldn&#39;t even bother trying...</em></p><br /><p>I believe that the world is changing. Our industry of software is changing. If we keep reacting to the same old situations in the same old way, we are contributing to keep things on the same old track and when we look at our greenfield code after a crazy rush and overtime of months, we&#39;ll blink puzzled and ask: how did we get here again?&#0160;</p><br /><p>Challenging situations are almost everyday in software development. Reaching a point of synergic equilibrium with our stakeholders where we can still have pride in our work is extremely hard mentally, because that&#39;s not how it was before for decades. </p><br /><p>We have to push back on impossible requirements and stick to zero tolerance for bugs in the belief that together with our clients we can find the solution without having to cut corners.</p><br /><p>&#0160;</p><br /><div id="blogsy_footer" style="text-align: right; font-size: small;"><a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"><img alt="Posted with Blogsy" height="20" src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" />Posted with Blogsy</a></div><br /><br/>
