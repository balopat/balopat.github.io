<p><strong>&#0160;</strong></p><br /><p><strong>Problems</strong> come. <strong>You</strong> solve them. You <strong>remember </strong>them.</p><br /><p>You hardly would be able to recall all of the problems you have solved in your life but you use these results every day.  In the art of software development patterns are your best friends. The emergent behavior resulting from these patterns is what you call a &quot;gut feeling&quot;, &quot;intuition&quot;. You feel when &quot;that&#39;s how it should be&quot; or more often &quot;this feels wrong&quot; and then you refactor.&#0160;</p><br /><p>From efficiency point of view we can agree that patterns are immensely important assets, basically shortcuts for problemsolving.</p><br /><p>We can also see then that <strong>your efficiency is strongly dependent on the number of new patterns you learn</strong> each day. Well nurtured and steadily grown pattern set can be your secret weapon, even if you do not remember all the problems you solve during these exercises, <strong>even if those problems are not even close to programming.</strong>&#0160;</p><br /><p>So why would you rely on &quot;natural progression&quot; when You Can Practice, consciously? When you can choose to move out of your comfort zone, why would you stay there slowly losing ability to learn?</p><br /><p>Do you think you are efficient enough?</p><br /><p>Do you think you learned enough already?</p><br /><p>Are you just simply lazy?</p><br /><p>You don&#39;t have enough time?</p><br /><p>Fair enough, but always remember to calibrate your dreams to your willingness of improving yourself.</p><br /><br/>
