The second Round Table with Software Craftsmanship New York was hosted in the fancy office space of DiMassimo Goldstein (http://digobrands.com/). Uma and Marc were very kind hosts and had a very good atmosphere in their meeting room spiced up with delicious pizza, beer and soda.  

_Disclaimer_: I am super tired as I am writing this blogpost so it might be that I leave something important out. In this case, please comment, and I'll adjust, thank you for your understanding! 

We started with **Lightning Talks**

Dan: Stan the statistics programming language

Li-Hsuan: The image of a developer

Rafael: Mentorship & Apprenticeship 

Balint: Handling time in a testable way


Then we voted on these **Discussion Topics** 

**Wrangling with big refactoring**

Tips and tricks around how to deal with a big refactoring. 

* We have to make a difference between redesign and refactoring 
* Minimise, or if possible avoid keeping the same functionality in two different version at the same time 
* Write system level tests first (baby step on top level) then make it green on the lower level

**Mentorship & Apprenticeship & Improving Software Craftsmanship New York**

* Finding mentors and apprentices is not easy - needs commitment from both ends - it's probably the most natural at the workplace 
* It definitely pays off to learn through mentorship
* Li-Hsuan shared his experiences at 8th Light 
    * he was an apprentice and had apprentices 
    * dealing with the apprentice takes daily commitment
    * every apprentice is unique and motivated by different learning methods and environments
* We mentioned craftsmanship-swaps
* We agreed to start work on a wiki/blog which will be owned by the community, Balint volunteered to create the initial bootstrap
* After we'll finalise the way we'd like to have mentorship, we can have a mentor-mentee speed-matching event! 

It was great fun and inspiration. 
I created the Github organisation for us, please send me a note to either @balopat on twitter, a comment here, or through meet up, and then I'll add you as a member, only criteria is that you have to be a SCNY member on meetup.com: 

<https://github.com/software-craftsmanship-new-york/>

I am going to create the blog tonight/tomorrow using Jekyll, and we can use the wiki I guess for brainstorming around our mentorship & apprenticeship principles.

Thank you again everyone for yesterday!
