<p>Unfortunately I had a lot of chance to meet <a href="http://theyjustdidit.com/telescopic-constructor-pattern/" target="_self">Telescopic Constructors </a>in my carrier and accepted it as a necessary evil. Now I found an antidote.</p>Yes, These constructors can become very nasty, because they are named the same whereas in fact they are representing the creation of different cases. A loan calculator is a good example for this where the different type of loan-products - as they are based on a single algorithm - are differ only in parameter values. I have seen real life loan calculator constructors marked with stray, eventually outdated comments about which is good for what.I recently ran into a simple and alternative solution what I&#0160;read in Joshua Keriewsky&#39;s book, which I highly recommend to every software developer: Refactoring to PatternsThe solution is to use creation methods instead of the constructors:<a href="http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/constructorCreation.html">http://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/constructorCreation.html</a>The only drawback is that if you start this refactoring, the creation of your objects will be inconsistent throughout the system. The huge benefit is the intention revealing code.<p>Example code on my github:&#0160;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/balopat/Refactoring-to-Patterns/compare/master...01_Replace_Constructors_With_Creation_Methods">https://github.com/balopat/Refactoring-to-Patterns/compare/master...01_Replace_Constructors_With_Creation_Methods</a></p><p>&#0160;</p>
