<p>In the last two weeks I was preparing a small pet project in my free time. It started as a small idea to learn Scalatra and Scala, Atmosphere, Less CSS, Heroku, Jade with Scalate, Specs2, Webdriver and PageObjects. &#0160;When I was showing it to my collegaues, I was surprised to see that such a small application turned out to be something already usable. </p><br /><p>So...As it is Christmas time and I have a lot to thank to the Software Craftsmanship Community - especially to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/" target="_blank" title="LSCC">LSCC</a>&#0160;founded by&#0160;Sandro Mancuso and David Green but including Uncle Bob, Corey Haines, Michael Feathers, Kent Beck, Dan North and Liz Keogh,&#0160; I would like to give</p><br /><p>&#0160;</p><br /><p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://codingboard.org" style="background: black; float: left;"><img alt="Codingboard_logo" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a015392885777970b017d3f21d9d5970c" src="http://blog.balopat.com/.a/6a015392885777970b017d3f21d9d5970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px;" title="Codingboard_logo" /></a>&#0160;</p><br /><p style="text-align: center;">&#0160;</p><br /><p>&#0160;</p><br /><p>&#0160;</p><br /><p>&#0160;</p><br /><p>as a Christmas Gift!!!
