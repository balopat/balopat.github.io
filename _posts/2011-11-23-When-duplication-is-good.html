<p>One of my biggest concerns against starting a blog was that &quot;they already wrote it, what can I add? Come on!&quot;.&#0160;As software developers&#0160;<strong>duplication is one of our biggest enemies</strong>. It slows us down, even the very proximity of potential duplicates makes us sweat - it is like Kryptonite for Superman.&#0160;</p><h2></h2><h2>Duplication creates rigid structures</h2><p>This holds true as long as we are talking about a <strong>code base</strong> because it is <strong>subject to constant change</strong>. Duplication works like a glue and <strong>creates a certain inflexibility by connecting </strong>parts of the system which could be independent otherwise.&#0160;</p><h2>Don&#39;t use it as an excuse</h2><p>On the other hand, using duplication <strong>as an excuse for not sharing</strong> knowledge, thoughts and opinion in a blog <strong>is simply not valid</strong>. Of course there is an extreme where a blog would copy-paste other blog-posts without mentioning the original author but in <strong>most of the cases</strong> duplication<strong> can be</strong> even <strong>beneficial</strong>!</p><h2>Duplications rule decisions</h2><p>On the web <em>duplication is everywhere. </em>From automated (e.g. Google News) to manual (all the &quot;Share it!&quot; type actions, e.g. ReTweet, etc.) there are lots of forms of it. <strong>The more a piece of information is repeated </strong>across the web <strong>the bigger impact</strong> it will have <strong>on</strong> your <strong>decisions and picture about reality</strong>. Why? Because it is impossible to try out everything by yourself, you have to trust the hundreds or thousands of people writing about it.&#0160;</p><p>Opinions about a product, a company will influence your opinion.&#0160;</p><p>If you find a way how to install a driver on Ubuntu and you don&#39;t manage to do it, but you find it in other sites as well, you might retry again. If you found the description only in a dusty corner of the web you might not beleive it. And that is alright as well, that is how our untrustful brain works.</p><h2>Share it!&#0160;</h2><p>Where am I going with this? When you have achieved something and want to share the joy and the proudness of your success, <strong>the thought of duplication should not stop you</strong>. <strong>On the contrary:</strong> it should motivate you and you should look at it as an ample opportunity to participate in this &quot;voting system&quot; about what reality is.&#0160;</p>
