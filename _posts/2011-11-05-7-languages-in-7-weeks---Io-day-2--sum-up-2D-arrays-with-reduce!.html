<p>I am fighting myself through the Io day 2 homework. Io is beautifully powerful, I really love the freedom it gives. You can put/redefine operators and methods&nbsp;<em>anywhere.&nbsp;</em></p><br /><p><em>&nbsp;</em>Some bits from my favourite solutions for day-2 follows here. &nbsp;</p><br /><br/><br/><br/><p>1. Fibonacci sequence (this is the recursive solution) </p><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1342355.js?file=fibRecursive.io"></script><br /><p>2.&nbsp;How would you change / to return 0 if the denominator is zero?</p><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1342357.js?file=divideOperator.io"></script><br /><p>3. Write a program to add up all of the numbers in a two-dimensional array.</p><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1342349.js?file=sum2DArray.io"></script><br /><p>How it works? List has a <a title="Reduce/List" href="http://www.iolanguage.com/scm/io/docs/reference/index.html#/Core/Core/List/reduce" target="_self">reduce</a>&nbsp;method:</p><br /><blockquote><br /><p>Also known as foldl or inject. Combines values in target starting on the left. If no initial value is passed the head of the list is used.&nbsp;</p><br /><pre>Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(+)<br />==&gt; 6<br />Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(xs, x, xs + x)<br />==&gt; 6<br />Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(+, -6) // Passing the initial value.<br />==&gt; 0<br />Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(xs, x, xs + x, -6)<br />==&gt; 0<br /></pre><br /></blockquote><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br />
