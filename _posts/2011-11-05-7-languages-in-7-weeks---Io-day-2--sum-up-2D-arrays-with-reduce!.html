<p>I am fighting myself through the Io day 2 homework. Io is beautifully powerful, I really love the freedom it gives. You can put/redefine operators and methods&nbsp;<em>anywhere.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em>Some bits from my favourite solutions for day-2 follows here. &nbsp;</p><p>1. Fibonacci sequence (this is the recursive solution) </p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1342355.js?file=fibRecursive.io"></script><p>2.&nbsp;How would you change / to return 0 if the denominator is zero?</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1342357.js?file=divideOperator.io"></script><p>3. Write a program to add up all of the numbers in a two-dimensional array.</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1342349.js?file=sum2DArray.io"></script><p>How it works? List has a <a title="Reduce/List" href="http://www.iolanguage.com/scm/io/docs/reference/index.html#/Core/Core/List/reduce" target="_self">reduce</a>&nbsp;method:</p><blockquote><p>Also known as foldl or inject. Combines values in target starting on the left. If no initial value is passed the head of the list is used.&nbsp;</p><pre>Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(+)==&gt; 6Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(xs, x, xs + x)==&gt; 6Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(+, -6) // Passing the initial value.==&gt; 0Io&gt; list(1, 2, 3) reduce(xs, x, xs + x, -6)==&gt; 0</pre></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
