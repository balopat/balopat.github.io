title: The spectrum of quantum complexities 
weight: 10

... draft ...

1. $BBP \in QBP \in PSPACE$, cool but large open questions 
2. covering the k-sphere: estimating unitaries is _in general_ hard 
3. Shor's algo
4. easy to simulate problems 
5. quantum supremacy: hard but not useful (or maybe)
6. what's in between? Which problems are going to benefit from a QC
