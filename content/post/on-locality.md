As I was skimming through Bernstein and Varizani's seminal '93 [paper defining quantum computation complexity theory](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=167088.167097) I had a thought: our obsession with local unitaries is what results in all the exponentiality. Why is this obsession? Are we really _bound_ by locality? Suddenly, thoughts about Feynman's '82 musings came to mind where he was talking about the local nature of physics in automatons...
