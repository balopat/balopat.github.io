Reading @activelazy's blogpost about integration testing 
     
     //TODO link 

made me think again a topic which I bump onto time to time. Dave makes a point that the whole decision whether you are writing integration tests or not is based on your "religion". This statement makes me kind of uncomfortable: I am not religious - but also because I like to think that I am a thinking human being, and not driven by dogmatic, unchecked beliefs, religion is not good enough for me.   


# Types of decisions 

## Architectural/design decisions 

## Methodology/process decisions 


# Types of arguments 


## Politics

because that's what's been told

## Belief

trusting thought leaders 

## Experience

you were burnt and learnt

## Estimates and assumptions

assuming the future

## Measurements

statistics

## Proof 

mathematically proven in theory so it works.
