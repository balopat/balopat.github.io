A couple of months ago, when I met with friends from the Hungarian quantum computing community, they asked me if I have a good explanation for CSS codes. I wasn't entirely prepared for the question so I gave a vague answer around the usual formal definition and a little bit of intuition that "codes that have separate X type and Z type stabilizer generators". The answer wasn't wrong, but since then I was thinking about this, and had the chance to give a presentation about hypergraph product codes [TODO cite] that has CSS codes at its heart. I felt that some of my fellow PhD students might benefit from a more intuitive description. 

# What is CSS and why is it important? 

If you are starting to learn about quantum error correction, chances are you ran across CSS codes. However, I found most explanations out there are lacking some key intuitiveness to them. 

The huge thing about CSS is that it allows creating good quantum codes from classical codes. This 


# History 

In the late 1990s, Peter Shor, Andrew Steane and Robert Calderbank worked on a series 


# Tower of spaces 

# Tanner graphs 


# Summary 

- CSS codes are an important first example that allow using classical codes to combine them into
