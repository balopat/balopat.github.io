It all started on Sunday 

# Impressions of the conference 


From a QEC researcher's perspective. Surprisingly many QEC people to meet. 
It is still an engineering and hardware heavy place. 


# Industry keynotes 

- Microsoft - narrow quantum computers down to chemistry. Add AI in the mix. Provide a fully integrated solution. 
- Google - XEB + great surface code experiment. Modularity to come. 
- Quantinuum - it's larger than I thought - 500+ employees compared to the 200-300 of Google and not sure how much of IBM. They are dedicated to modularity with QCCD. 
- IBM - LDPC codes + modularity to come. 


# Academia keynotes 

Refreshing to see less polished slides. 

- Ken Brown - funny, thoughtprovoking 
- Margaret Martonosi - what a character 
- Eleanor Rieffel - the most curiousity inducing. 

# QEC talks 

- Andrew Cross 
- Ken Brown 
- Mike Newman 

- Decoders - impressed by the Yale result of 279 ns
- Modularity 
- GNARSIL - a cool algorithm to 
- Qudits - best paper award 

# Fun stuff: 

- Irreversible - memristors 


- ZX calculus - met Bob Coecke 
- Talked to a lot of people 


# Poster 

- T-contextuality 
- Ambiguity clustering 
- My own 


# Impressions of Montreal 

* Eclectic! 
* A mixture of old and new 
* delicious food
