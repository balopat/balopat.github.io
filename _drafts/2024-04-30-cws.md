## Introduction 

Interestingly, codeword stabilized codes allow for a standardized view of any stabilizer code that transforms them into a classical code. In this standard form a graph state and its translates span the codespace. I got curious and wanted to see what the classical codes for the most famous codes look like.  

## The 5 qubit code 

One of the examples from the original paper is the [[5,1,3]] code.
