	abstract = {An n-qubit quantum circuit performs a unitary operation on an exponentially large, 2n-dimensional, Hilbert space, which is a major source of quantum speed-ups. We develop a new “Quantum singular value transformation” algorithm that can directly harness the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized by quantum circuits with a very simple structure - typically using only a constant number of ancilla qubits - leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors. We show that our framework allows describing many quantum algorithms on a high level, and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to various quantum machine learning applications. We also devise a new singular vector transformation algorithm, describe how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum, and show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. Finally, we also prove a quantum lower bound on spectral transformations.},

	abstract = {The development of a framework for quantifying ‘non-stabilizerness’ of quantum operations is motivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant quantum computation and by the need to estimate classical simulation cost for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The robustness of magic was recently proposed as a well-behaved magic monotone for multi-qubit states and quantifies the simulation overhead of circuits composed of Clifford + T gates, or circuits using other gates from the Clifford hierarchy. Here we present a general theory of the ‘non-stabilizerness’ of quantum operations rather than states, which are useful for classical simulation of more general circuits. We introduce two magic monotones, called channel robustness and magic capacity, which are well-defined for general n-qubit channels and treat all stabilizer-preserving CPTP maps as free operations. We present two complementary Monte Carlo-type classical simulation algorithms with sample complexity given by these quantities and provide examples of channels where the complexity of our algorithms is exponentially better than previously known simulators. We present additional techniques that ease the difficulty of calculating our monotones for special classes of channels.},

	abstract = {We consider a model of quantum computation in which the set of elementary operations is limited to Clifford unitaries, the creation of the state \${\textbar}0{\textbackslash}rangle\$ computational basis. In addition, we allow the creation of a one-qubit ancilla in a mixed state \${\textbackslash}rho\$, which should be regarded as a parameter of the model. Our goal is to determine for which \${\textbackslash}rho\$ universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain "magic" directions. If the polarization of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ along a magic direction exceeds a threshold value (about 65\%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure state, which we call a magic state. We show that the Clifford group operations combined with magic states preparation are sufficient for UQC. The connection of our results with the Gottesman-Knill theorem is discussed.},

	abstract = {Quantum coherence is a critical resource for many operational tasks. Understanding how to quantify and manipulate it also promises to have applications for a diverse set of problems in theoretical physics. For certain applications, however, one requires coherence between the eigenspaces of specific physical observables, such as energy, angular momentum, or photon number, and it makes a difference which eigenspaces appear in the superposition. For others, there is a preferred set of subspaces relative to which coherence is deemed a resource, but it is irrelevant which of the subspaces appear in the superposition. We term these two types of coherence unspeakable and speakable respectively. We argue that a useful approach to quantifying and characterizing unspeakable coherence is provided by the resource theory of asymmetry when the symmetry group is a group of translations, and we translate a number of prior results on asymmetry into the language of coherence. We also highlight some of the applications of this approach, for instance, in the context of quantum metrology, quantum speed limits, quantum thermodynamics, and NMR. The question of how best to treat speakable coherence as a resource is also considered. We review a popular approach in terms of operations that preserve the set of incoherent states, propose an alternative approach in terms of operations that are covariant under dephasing, and we outline the challenge of providing a physical justification for either approach. Finally, we note some mathematical connections that hold among the different approaches to quantifying coherence.},

This divides the state space into various sets, including states which are free (because they can be created under the class of operations), and those which are a resource (because they cannot be). One can quantify the worth of the resource by the relative entropy distance to the set of free states, and under certain conditions, this is a unique measure which quantifies the rate of state to state transitions. The framework includes entanglement, asymmetry and purity theory. It also includes thermodynamics, which is a hybrid resource theory combining purity theory and asymmetry. Another hybrid resource theory which merges purity theory and entanglement can be used to study quantumness of correlations and discord, and we present quantumness in this more general framework of resource theories.},

This perspective discusses the major features of DMRG, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses also in comparison with other novel approaches. The method is presented following its historical development, starting from its original formulation up to its most recent applications. Possible routes to recover dynamical correlation are discussed in detail. Emerging new fields of applications of DMRG are explored, such as its time-dependent formulation and the application to vibrational spectroscopy.},

However, QPE requires a large number of ancilla qubits and a large circuit depth, as well as the ability to perform inverse quantum Fourier transform, making it expensive to implement on an early fault-tolerant quantum computer. We propose an alternative method to estimate the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian with Heisenberg-limited precision scaling, which employs a simple quantum circuit with one ancilla qubit, and a classical postprocessing procedure. Besides the ground-state energy, our algorithm also produces an approximate cumulative distribution function of the spectral measure, which can be used to compute other spectral properties of the Hamiltonian.},

What is the rate at which arbitrarily many copies of one resource can be converted into arbitrarily many copies of another? Can a catalyst help in making an impossible transformation possible? How does one quantify the resource? Here, we propose a general mathematical definition of what constitutes a resource theory. We prove some general theorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of processes wherein there is a special class of processes that are implementable at no cost and which define the means by which the costly states and processes can be interconverted one to another. We outline how various existing resource theories fit into our framework.

Although both of these notions were meant to characterize the conditions under which a classical explanation cannot be provided, we demonstrate that they prove inadequate to the task and we argue for a particular way of generalizing and revising them. With the refined version of each in hand, it becomes apparent that they are in fact one and the same.

	abstract = {Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs revolutionize the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems like entanglement, elevating them from just being interesting from a fundamental point of view to being useful in performing practical tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions on physical systems, and that consists of all the physical processes allowed by the resource theory and which acts invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. In this article we review the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied QRTs in the literature.},

	abstract = {Stabilizer operations (SO) occupy a prominent role in fault-tolerant quantum computing. They are defined operationally by the use of Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and classical control. These operations can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, a result which is known as the Gottesman–Knill theorem. However, an additional supply of magic states is enough to promote them to a universal, fault-tolerant model for quantum computing. To quantify the needed resources in terms of magic states, a resource theory of magic has been developed. SO are considered free within this theory; however, they are not the most general class of free operations. From an axiomatic point of view, these are the completely stabilizer-preserving (CSP) channels, defined as those that preserve the convex hull of stabilizer states. It has been an open problem to decide whether these two definitions lead to the same class of operations. In this work, we answer this question in the negative, by constructing an explicit counter-example. This indicates that recently proposed stabilizer-based simulation techniques of CSP maps are strictly more powerful than Gottesman–Knill-like methods. The result is analogous to a well-known fact in entanglement theory, namely, that there is a gap between the operationally defined class of local operations and classical communication and the axiomatically defined class of separable channels.},

This framework embraces noise as a resource, and consequently, offers a number of advantages compared to one based on unitary dynamics alone, e.g., that the protocols are typically independent of the initial state of the system. However, the time independent nature of this scheme makes it difficult to imagine precisely timed sequential operations, conditional measurements or error correction. In this work, we provide a path around these challenges, by introducing basic dissipative gadgets which allow us to precisely initiate, trigger and time dissipative operations, while keeping the system Liouvillian time-independent. These gadgets open up novel perspectives for thinking of timed dissipative quantum information processing. As an example, we sketch how measurement based computation can be simulated in the dissipative setting.},

	abstract = {Logical gates are the building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computation. While quantum error-corrected memories have been extensively studied in the literature, detailed analyses of thresholds and resource overheads of universal logical gate sets have so far been limited. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for universal fault-tolerant logic motivated by the combined need for (i) platform-independent logical gate definitions, (ii) flexible and scalable tools for numerical analysis, and (iii) exploration of novel schemes for universal logic that improve resource overheads. We first introduce the theory of fault-tolerant channels for describing logical gates holistically in space-time. Focusing on channels based on surface codes, we introduce explicit, platform-independent representations of topological logic gates -- called logical blocks -- and generate new, overhead-efficient methods for universal quantum computation. As a specific example, we propose fault-tolerant schemes based on surface codes concatenated with more general low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. The logical blocks framework enables a convenient mapping from an abstract description of the logical gate to a precise set of physical instructions for both circuit-based and fusion-based quantum computation (FBQC). Using this, we numerically simulate a surface-code-based universal gate set implemented with FBQC, and verify that the threshold for fault-tolerant gates is consistent with the bulk memory threshold. We find that boundaries, defects, and twists, can significantly impact the logical error rate scaling, with periodic boundary conditions potentially halving the memory resource requirements. Motivated by the favorable logical error rate suppression for boundaryless computation, we introduce a novel computational scheme based on the teleportation of twists that may offer further resource reductions.},

Here we show how to perform a fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate with the surface code; a quantum error-correcting code now under intensive development. This alleviates the need for distillation or higher-dimensional components to complete a universal gate set. The operation uses both local transversal gates and code deformations over a time that scales with the size of the qubit array. An important component of the gate is a just-in-time decoder. These decoding algorithms allow us to draw upon the advantages of three-dimensional models using only a two-dimensional array of live qubits. Our gate is completed using parity checks of weight no greater than four. We therefore expect it to be amenable with near-future technology. As the gate circumvents the need for magic-state distillation, it may reduce the resource overhead of surface-code quantum computation considerably.},

Here we propose a cellular automaton decoder for a variation of the color code where the bases of the physical qubits are locally rotated, which we call the XYZ color code. The local transformation means our decoder demonstrates key properties of a two-dimensional fractal code if the noise acting on the system is infinitely biased towards dephasing, namely, no string-like logical operators. As such, in the high-bias limit, our local decoder reproduces the behavior of a partially self-correcting memory. At low error rates, our simulations show that the memory time diverges polynomially with system size without intervention from a global decoder, up to some critical system size that grows as the error rate is lowered. Furthermore, although we find that we cannot reproduce partially self-correcting behavior at finite bias, our numerics demonstrate improved memory times at realistic noise biases. Our results therefore motivate the design of tailored cellular automaton decoders that help to reduce the bandwidth demands of global decoding for realistic noise models.},

Specifically, we assume that the stabilizer group of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes) can be generated by local Pauli operators such that the support of any generator is bounded by a hypercube of size O(1). Our first result concerns the optimal scaling of the distance d with the linear size of the lattice L. We prove an upper bound d=O(LD-1) which is tight for D=1, 2. This bound applies to both subspace and subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability of stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory. Any stabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally transformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate the stabilizer condition. A degenerate ground state of this Hamiltonian corresponds to the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for D=1, 2, different logical states can be mapped into each other by a sequence of single-qubit Pauli errors such that the energy of all intermediate states is upper bounded by a constant independent of the lattice size L. The same result holds if there are unused logical qubits that are treated as ‘gauge qubits’. It demonstrates that a self-correcting quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer codes in dimensions D=1, 2. This result is in sharp contrast with the existence of a classical self-correcting memory in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet. Our results leave open the possibility for a self-correcting quantum memory based on 2D subsystem codes or on 3D subspace or subsystem codes.},

Such an error correction step is shown to require a finite error threshold, the lack thereof being exemplified by the 3D compass model.

The model is supported by a certain class of gapped spin Hamiltonians, called stabilizer Hamiltonians, with translation symmetries and a small number of ground states that does not grow with the system size. We show that the model does not work as self-correcting quantum memory due to a certain topological constraint on geometric shapes of its logical operators. This quantum coding theoretical result implies that systems covered or approximated by the model cannot have thermally stable topological order, meaning that systems cannot be stable against both thermal fluctuations and local perturbations simultaneously in two and three spatial dimensions.},

Still, there is a solution in 2 dimensions, and this solution can be used to construct a simple 3-dimensional discrete-time universal fault-tolerant cellular automaton. This technique does not help much to solve the following problems: remembering a bit of information in 1 dimension; computing in dimensions lower than 3; computing in any dimension with non-synchronized transitions. Our more complex technique organizes the cells in blocks that perform a reliable simulation of a second (generalized) cellular automaton. The cells of the latter automaton are also organized in blocks, simulating even more reliably a third automaton, etc. Since all this (a possibly infinite hierarchy) is organized in ``software'', it must be under repair all the time from damage caused by errors. A large part of the problem is essentially self-stabilization recovering from a mess of arbitrary size and content. The present paper constructs an asynchronous one-dimensional fault-tolerant cellular automaton, with the further feature of ``self-organization''. The latter means that unless a large amount of input information must be given, the initial configuration can be chosen homogeneous.},

	abstract = {The successes and limitations of statistical sampling for a sequence of models studied in the context of lattice QCD are discussed and the need for new methods to deal with finite-density and real-time evolution is emphasized. It is shown that these lattice models can be reformulated using tensorial methods where the field integrations in the path-integral formalism are replaced by discrete sums. These formulations involve various types of duality and provide exact coarse-graining formulas that can be combined with truncations to obtain practical implementations of the Wilson renormalization group program. Tensor reformulations are naturally discrete and provide manageable transfer matrices. Truncations with the time continuum limit are combined, and Hamiltonians suitable for performing quantum simulation experiments, for instance, using cold atoms, or to be programmed on existing quantum computers, are derived. Recent progress concerning the tensor field theory treatment of noncompact scalar models, supersymmetric models, economical four-dimensional algorithms, noise-robust enforcement of Gauss’s law, symmetry preserving truncations, and topological considerations are reviewed. Connections with other tensor network approaches are also discussed.},

These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e., qubits that are not error corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations within a limited coherence time. In the search for achieving quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. The overarching goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms is provided. The key structure of these algorithms and their limitations and advantages are discussed.

The ML algorithm is computationally efficient even when the unknown process is a quantum circuit with exponentially many gates. Our algorithm combines efficient procedures for learning properties of an unknown state and for learning a low-degree approximation to an unknown observable. The analysis hinges on proving new norm inequalities, including a quantum analogue of the classical Bohnenblust-Hille inequality, which we derive by giving an improved algorithm for optimizing local Hamiltonians. Overall, our results highlight the potential for ML models to predict the output of complex quantum dynamics much faster than the time needed to run the process itself.},

Here we compute storage times with and without disorder for quantum chains with unpaired Majorana fermions - the simplest toy model of a quantum memory. Disorder takes the form of a random site-dependent chemical potential. The corresponding one-particle problem is a one-dimensional Anderson model with disorder in the hopping amplitudes. We focus on the zero-temperature storage of a qubit encoded in the ground state of the Majorana chain. Storage and retrieval are modeled by a unitary evolution under the memory Hamiltonian with an unknown weak perturbation followed by an error-correction step. Assuming dynamical localization of the one-particle problem, we show that the storage time grows exponentially with the system size. We give supporting evidence for the required localization property by estimating Lyapunov exponents of the one-particle eigenfunctions. We also simulate the storage process for chains with a few hundred sites. Our numerical results indicate that in the absence of disorder, the storage time grows only as a logarithm of the system size. We provide numerical evidence for the beneficial effect of disorder on storage times and show that suitably chosen pseudorandom potentials can outperform random ones.},

In this perspective we explore decoding algorithms for the surface code; a prototypical quantum low-density parity-check code that underlies many of the leading efforts to demonstrate scalable quantum computing. Central to our discussion is the minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder. The decoder works by exploiting underlying structure that arises due to materialised symmetries among surface-code stabilizer elements. By concentrating on these symmetries, we begin to address the question of how a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder might be generalised for other types of code. We approach this question first by investigating examples of matching decoders for other codes. These include decoding algorithms that have been specialised to correct for noise models that demonstrate a particular structure or bias with respect to certain types of code. In addition to this, we propose a systematic way of constructing a minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder for codes with certain characteristic properties. The properties we make use of are common among topological codes. We discuss the broader applicability of the proposal, and we suggest some questions we can address that may show us how to design a generalised matching decoder for arbitrary stabilizer codes.},

More precisely, we use the well-known universal description of quantum commuting correlations as state space on the universal algebra for two player games, and so allows us to unambigiously compare quantum strategies as states on this common algebra. As such we find that the CHSH game leaves a single optimal state on this common algebra. In turn passing to any non-minimal Stinespring dilation for this unique optimal state is the only source of ambiguity (including self-testing): More precisely, any state on some operator algebra may be uniquely broken up into its minimal Stinespring dilation as an honest representation for the operator algebra followed by its vector state. Any other Stinespring dilation however arises simply as an extension of the minimal Stinespring dilation (i.e., as an embedding of the minimal Hilbert space into some random ambient one). As such this manifests the only source of ambiguity appearing in most (but not all!) traditional self-testing results such as for the CHSH game as well as in plenty of similar examples. We then further demonstrate the simplicity of our arguments on the Mermin--Peres magic square and magic pentagram game. Most importantly however, we present this article as an illustration of operator algebraic techniques on optimal states and their quotients, and we further pick up the results of the current article in another following one (currently under preparation) to derive a first robust self-testing result in the quantum commuting model.},

We find that, similarly to the case of incoherent bit- and phase-flips, a trade-off between resilience against coherent \$X\$- and \$Z\$-rotations can be made via the connectivity of the graph. However, our results indicate that, unlike in the incoherent case, the error-correction thresholds for the various graphs do not approach a universal bound. We also study the distribution of final states after error correction. We show that graphs fall into three distinct classes, each resulting in qualitatively distinct final-state distributions. In particular, we show that a graph class exists where the logical-level noise exhibits a decoherence threshold slightly above the error-correction threshold. In these classes, therefore, the logical level noise above the error-correction threshold can retain significant amount of coherence even for large-distance codes. To perform our analysis, we develop a Majorana-fermion representation of planar-graph surface codes and describe the characterization of logical-state storage using fermion-linear-optics-based simulations.

	abstract = {Quantum many-body systems involving bosonic modes or gauge fields have infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces which must be truncated to perform simulations of real-time dynamics on classical or quantum computers. To analyze the truncation error, we develop methods for bounding the rate of growth of local quantum numbers such as the occupation number of a mode at a lattice site, or the electric field at a lattice link. Our approach applies to various models of bosons interacting with spins or fermions, and also to both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories. We show that if states in these models are truncated by imposing an upper limit \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ on each local quantum number, and if the initial state has low local quantum numbers, then an error at most \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ can be achieved by choosing \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ to scale polylogarithmically with \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, an exponential improvement over previous bounds based on energy conservation. For the Hubbard-Holstein model, we numerically compute a bound on \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ that achieves accuracy \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, obtaining significantly improved estimates in various parameter regimes. We also establish a criterion for truncating the Hamiltonian with a provable guarantee on the accuracy of time evolution. Building on that result, we formulate quantum algorithms for dynamical simulation of lattice gauge theories and of models with bosonic modes; the gate complexity depends almost linearly on spacetime volume in the former case, and almost quadratically on time in the latter case. We establish a lower bound showing that there are systems involving bosons for which this quadratic scaling with time cannot be improved. By applying our result on the truncation error in time evolution, we also prove that spectrally isolated energy eigenstates can be approximated with accuracy \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ by truncating local quantum numbers at \${\textbackslash}Lambda={\textbackslash}textrm\{polylog\}({\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$.},

In our approach, logic gates operate via logical Pauli measurements that preserve both the protection of the LDPC codes as well as the low overheads in terms of the required number of additional qubits. Compared with surface codes with the same code distance, we estimate order-of-magnitude improvements in the overheads for processing around one hundred logical qubits using this approach. Given the high thresholds demonstrated by LDPC codes, our estimates suggest that fault-tolerant quantum computation at this scale may be achievable with a few thousand physical qubits at comparable error rates to what is needed for current approaches.},

For a wide range of codes we analytically compute the effective logical channel that results when the error correction steps are performed noiselessly. Our examples include the entire family of repetition codes, the 5-qubit, Steane, Shor, and surface codes. When errors are measured in terms of the diamond norm, we find that the error correction is typically much more effective for unitary errors than for dephasing. We observe this behavior for a wide range of codes after a single level of encoding, and in the thresholds of concatenated codes using hard decoders. We show that this holds with great generality by proving a bound on the performance of any stabilizer code when the noise at the physical level is unitary. By comparing the diamond norm error \$D'\_{\textbackslash}diamond\$ of the logical qubit with the same quantity at the physical level \$D\_{\textbackslash}diamond\$, we show that \$D'\_{\textbackslash}diamond {\textbackslash}le c D{\textasciicircum}d\_{\textbackslash}diamond \$ where \$d\$ is the distance of the code and \$c\$ is constant that depends on the code but not on the error. This bound compares very favorably to the performance of error correction for dephasing noise and other Pauli channels, where an error correcting code of odd distance \$d\$ will exhibit a scaling \$D'\_{\textbackslash}diamond {\textbackslash}sim D\_{\textbackslash}diamond{\textasciicircum}\{(d+1)/2\}\$.},

	abstract = {The challenge of quantum computing is to combine error resilience with universal computation. Diagonal gates such as the transversal \$T\$ gate play an important role in implementing a universal set of quantum operations. This paper introduces a framework that describes the process of preparing a code state, applying a diagonal physical gate, measuring a code syndrome, and applying a Pauli correction that may depend on the measured syndrome (the average logical channel induced by an arbitrary diagonal gate). It focuses on CSS codes, and describes the interaction of code states and physical gates in terms of generator coefficients determined by the induced logical operator. The interaction of code states and diagonal gates depends very strongly on the signs of \$Z\$-stabilizers in the CSS code, and the proposed generator coefficient framework explicitly includes this degree of freedom. The paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary diagonal gate to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, and provides an explicit expression of the induced logical operator. When the diagonal gate is a quadratic form diagonal gate (introduced by Rengaswamy et al.), the conditions can be expressed in terms of divisibility of weights in the two classical codes that determine the CSS code. These codes find application in magic state distillation and elsewhere. When all the signs are positive, the paper characterizes all possible CSS codes, invariant under transversal \$Z\$-rotation through \${\textbackslash}pi/2{\textasciicircum}l\$, that are constructed from classical Reed-Muller codes by deriving the necessary and sufficient constraints on \$l\$. The generator coefficient framework extends to arbitrary stabilizer codes but there is nothing to be gained by considering the more general class of non-degenerate stabilizer codes.},

	abstract = {We study the effectiveness of quantum error correction against coherent noise. Coherent errors (for example, unitary noise) can interfere constructively, so that in some cases the average inﬁdelity of a quantum circuit subjected to coherent errors may increase quadratically with the circuit size; in contrast, when errors are incoherent (for example, depolarizing noise), the average inﬁdelity increases at worst linearly with circuit size. We consider the performance of quantum stabilizer codes against a noise model in which a unitary rotation is applied to each qubit, where the axes and angles of rotation are nearly the same for all qubits. In particular, we show that for the toric code subject to such independent coherent noise, and for minimal-weight decoding, the logical channel after error correction becomes increasingly incoherent as the length of the code increases, provided the noise strength decays inversely with the code distance. A similar conclusion holds for weakly correlated coherent noise. Our methods can also be used for analyzing the performance of other codes and fault-tolerant protocols against coherent noise. However, our result does not show that the coherence of the logical channel is suppressed in the more physically relevant case where the noise strength is held constant as the code block grows, and we recount the difﬁculties that prevented us from extending the result to that case. Nevertheless our work supports the idea that fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes will work effectively against coherent noise, providing encouraging news for quantum hardware builders who worry about the damaging effects of control errors and coherent interactions with the environment.},

Here we gather the evidence for this case in the most common task in quantum chemistry, namely, ground-state energy estimation. We conclude that evidence for such an advantage across chemical space has yet to be found.

In practice, quantum computers must operate with noisy devices called ``gates'' that tend to destroy the fragile quantum states needed for computation. The goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing is to compute accurately even when gates have a high probability of error each time they are used. Here we give evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible with error probabilities above 3\% per gate, which is significantly higher than what was previously thought possible. However, the resources required for computing at such high error probabilities are excessive. Fortunately, they decrease rapidly with decreasing error probabilities. If we had quantum resources comparable to the considerable resources available in today's digital computers, we could implement non-trivial quantum computations at error probabilities as high as 1\% per gate.},

One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t){\textasciicircum}c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.},

Speeding up error correction will also speed up an encoded quantum computation, and should reduce its effective error rate. We give both code-specific and general methods, using a variety of techniques and in a variety of settings. We design new quantum error-correcting codes specifically for efficient error correction, e.g., allowing single-shot error correction. For codes with multiple logical qubits, we give methods for combining error correction with partial logical measurements. There are tradeoffs in choosing a code and error-correction technique. While to date most work has concentrated on optimizing the syndrome-extraction procedure, we show that there are also substantial benefits to optimizing how the measured syndromes are chosen and used. As an example, we design single-shot measurement sequences for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with the 16-qubit extended Hamming code. Our scheme uses 10 syndrome bit measurements, compared to 40 measurements with the Shor scheme. We design single-shot logical measurements as well: any logical Z measurement can be made together with fault-tolerant error correction using only 11 measurements. For comparison, using the Shor scheme a basic implementation of such a non-destructive logical measurement uses 63 measurements. We also offer ten open problems, the solutions of which could lead to substantial improvements of fault-tolerant error correction.},

The family is constructed by amalgamating classical codes and Ramanujan graphs via an operation called balanced product.

However, their constructions are based on probabilistic arguments which only guarantee the code parameters with high probability whereas our bounds hold unconditionally. Further, balanced products allow for non-abelian twisting of the check matrices, leading to a construction of LDPC quantum codes that can be shown to have \$K{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Theta(N)\$ and that we conjecture to have linear distance \$D{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Theta(N)\$.},

For a stabilizer code that can correct up to \$t\$ errors, the traditional Shor scheme handles ancilla preparation and measurement faults by performing syndrome measurements until the syndromes are repeated \$t+1\$ times in a row; in the worst-case scenario, \$(t+1){\textasciicircum}2\$ rounds of measurements are required. In this work, we improve the Shor FTEC scheme using an adaptive syndrome measurement technique. In particular, our protocols determine a syndrome for error correction based on information from the differences of syndromes obtained from any two consecutive rounds. Our protocol that satisfies the strong FTEC conditions requires no more than \$(t+3){\textasciicircum}2/4-1\$ rounds of measurements and is applicable to any stabilizer code. Compared to the traditional method, we estimate that our adaptive measurement method could increase the fault-tolerant threshold by a factor of 4 in the large \$t\$ limit.

              Executing quantum algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits is a critical step for scalable quantum computing, but the requisite numbers of qubits and physical error rates are demanding for current experimental hardware. Recently, the development of error correcting codes tailored to particular physical noise models has helped relax these requirements. In this work, we propose a qubit encoding and gate protocol for
              171
              Yb neutral atom qubits that converts the dominant physical errors into erasures, that is, errors in known locations. The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98\% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937\% to 4.15\%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.},

Here, we develop a characterization technique to benchmark the implementation precision of a specific quantum simulation task. We infer all parameters of the bosonic Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of excitations in a two-dimensional grid of nearest-neighbour coupled superconducting qubits. We devise a robust algorithm for identification of Hamiltonian parameters from measured times series of the expectation values of single-mode canonical coordinates. Using super-resolution and denoising methods, we first extract eigenfrequencies of the governing Hamiltonian from the complex time domain measurement; next, we recover the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian via constrained manifold optimization over the orthogonal group. For five and six coupled qubits, we identify Hamiltonian parameters with sub-MHz precision and construct a spatial implementation error map for a grid of 27 qubits. Our approach enables us to distinguish and quantify the effects of state preparation and measurement errors and show that they are the dominant sources of errors in the implementation. Our results quantify the implementation accuracy of analog dynamics and introduce a diagnostic toolkit for understanding, calibrating, and improving analog quantum processors.},

The noise level which can be tolerated in a fault-tolerant method is therefore a function of the computational resources available, especially the size of computer and degree of parallelism. I present an analysis of error correction with block codes, made fault-tolerant through the use of prepared ancilla blocks. The preparation and verification of the ancillas is described in detail. It is shown that the ancillas need only be verified against a small set of errors. This, combined with previously known advantages, makes this `ancilla factory' the best method to apply error correction, whether in concatenated or block coding. I then consider the resources required to achieve \$2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ computational steps reliably in a computer of 2150 logical qubits, finding that the simplest \$[[n,1,d]]\$ block codes can tolerate more noise with smaller overheads than the \$7{\textasciicircum}L\$-bit concatenated code. The scaling is such that block codes remain the better choice for all computations one is likely to contemplate.},

In this paper, we propose a procedure for general CSS codes of distance three so that multiple \$Z\$-stabilizers (\$X\$-stabilizers) can be fault-tolerantly measured in parallel with one shared flag qubit.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06431},
	abstract = {Practical quantum computing will require error rates that are well below what is achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction offers a path to algorithmically-relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, where increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low in order for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here, we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across multiple code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, both in terms of logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle (\$2.914{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm 0.016{\textbackslash}\%\$ compared to \$3.028{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm 0.023{\textbackslash}\%\$). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a \$1.7{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ logical error per round floor set by a single high-energy event (\$1.6{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$ when excluding this event). We are able to accurately model our experiment, and from this model we can extract error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark the first experimental demonstration where quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

Here we show that a variant of the surface code -- the XZZX code -- offers remarkable performance for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The error threshold of this code matches what can be achieved with random codes (hashing) for every single-qubit Pauli noise channel; it is the first explicit code shown to have this universal property. We present numerical evidence that the threshold even exceeds this hashing bound for an experimentally relevant range of noise parameters. Focusing on the common situation where qubit dephasing is the dominant noise, we show that this code has a practical, high-performance decoder and surpasses all previously known thresholds in the realistic setting where syndrome measurements are unreliable. We go on to demonstrate the favourable sub-threshold resource scaling that can be obtained by specialising a code to exploit structure in the noise. We show that it is possible to maintain all of these advantages when we perform fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

            The color code is a topological quantum error-correcting code supporting a variety of valuable fault-tolerant logical gates. Its two-dimensional version, the triangular color code, may soon be realized with currently available superconducting hardware despite constrained qubit connectivity. To guide this experimental effort, we study the storage threshold of the triangular color code against circuit-level depolarizing noise. First, we adapt the Restriction Decoder to the setting of the triangular color code and to phenomenological noise. Then, we propose a fault-tolerant implementation of the stabilizer measurement circuits, which incorporates flag qubits. We show how information from flag qubits can be used in an efficient and scalable way with the Restriction Decoder to maintain the effective distance of the code. We numerically estimate the threshold of the triangular color code to be 0.2\%, which is competitive with the thresholds of other topological quantum codes. We also prove that 1-flag stabilizer measurement circuits are sufficient to preserve the full code distance, which may be used to find simpler syndrome extraction circuits of the color code.},

In the literature, several such conditions have been introduced. The most well-known ones are the mutual coherence, the restricted isometry property (RIP), and the nullspace property (NSP). While evaluating the mutual coherence of a given matrix is easy, it has been suspected for some time that evaluating RIP and NSP is computationally intractable in general. We confirm these conjectures by showing that for a given matrix A and positive integer k, computing the best constants for which the RIP or NSP hold is, in general, NP-hard. These results are based on the fact that determining the spark of a matrix is NP-hard, which is also established in this paper. Furthermore, we also give several complexity statements about problems related to the above concepts.},

For fault-tolerant operation quantum computers must correct errors occurring due to unavoidable decoherence and limited control accuracy. Here, we demonstrate quantum error correction using the surface code, which is known for its exceptionally high tolerance to errors. Using 17 physical qubits in a superconducting circuit we encode quantum information in a distance-three logical qubit building up on recent distance-two error detection experiments. In an error correction cycle taking only \$1.1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu\$s, we demonstrate the preservation of four cardinal states of the logical qubit. Repeatedly executing the cycle, we measure and decode both bit- and phase-flip error syndromes using a minimum-weight perfect-matching algorithm in an error-model-free approach and apply corrections in postprocessing. We find a low error probability of \$3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ per cycle when rejecting experimental runs in which leakage is detected. The measured characteristics of our device agree well with a numerical model. Our demonstration of repeated, fast and high-performance quantum error correction cycles, together with recent advances in ion traps, support our understanding that fault-tolerant quantum computation will be practically realizable.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02649},
	abstract = {Attaining fault tolerance while maintaining low overhead is one of the main challenges in a practical implementation of quantum circuits. One major technique that can overcome this problem is the flag technique, in which high-weight errors arising from a few faults can be detected by a few ancillas and distinguished using subsequent syndrome measurements. The technique can be further improved using the fact that for some families of codes, errors of any weight are logically equivalent if they have the same syndrome and weight parity, as previously shown in [arXiv:2006.03068]. In this work, we develop a notion of distinguishable fault set which capture both concepts of flags and weight parities, and extend the use of weight parities in error correction from [arXiv:2006.03068] to a family of capped color codes. We also develop fault-tolerant protocols for error correction, measurement, and state preparation, which are sufficient for implementing any Clifford operation fault-tolerantly on a capped color code. Our protocols for capped color codes of distance 3, 5, and 7 require only 1, 1, and 2 ancillas. The concept of distinguishable fault set also leads to a generalization of the definitions of fault-tolerant gadgets proposed by Aliferis, Gottesman, and Preskill.},

Remarkably, this honeycomb code assembles weight-six parity checks using only two-local measurements. The sparse connectivity and two-local measurements are desirable features for certain hardware, while the weight-six parity checks enable robust performance in the circuit model. In this work, we quantify the robustness of logical qubits preserved by the honeycomb code using a correlated minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder. Using Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the honeycomb code's threshold in different error models, and project how efficiently it can reach the "teraquop regime" where trillions of quantum logical operations can be executed reliably. We perform the same estimates for the rotated surface code, and find a threshold of \$0.2{\textbackslash}\%-0.3{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the honeycomb code compared to a threshold of \$0.5{\textbackslash}\%-0.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the surface code in a controlled-not circuit model. In a circuit model with native two-body measurements, the honeycomb code achieves a threshold of \$1.5{\textbackslash}\% {\textless} p {\textless}2.0{\textbackslash}\%\$, where \$p\$ is the collective error rate of the two-body measurement gate - including both measurement and correlated data depolarization error processes. With such gates at a physical error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, we project that the honeycomb code can reach the teraquop regime with only \$600\$ physical qubits.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11923},
	abstract = {Magic state distillation and the Shor factoring algorithm make essential use of logical diagonal gates. We introduce a method of synthesizing CSS codes that realize a target logical diagonal gate at some level \$l\$ in the Clifford hierarchy. The method combines three basic operations: concatenation, removal of \$Z\$-stabilizers, and addition of \$X\$-stabilizers. It explicitly tracks the logical gate induced by a diagonal physical gate that preserves a CSS code. The first step is concatenation, where the input is a CSS code and a physical diagonal gate at level \$l\$ inducing a logical diagonal gate at the same level. The output is a new code for which a physical diagonal gate at level \$l+1\$ induces the original logical gate. The next step is judicious removal of \$Z\$-stabilizers to increase the level of the induced logical operator. We identify three ways of climbing the logical Clifford hierarchy from level \$l\$ to level \$l+1\$, each built on a recursive relation on the Pauli coefficients of the induced logical operators. Removal of \$Z\$-stabilizers may reduce distance, and the purpose of the third basic operation, addition of \$X\$-stabilizers, is to compensate for such losses. For the coherent noise model, we describe how to switch between computation and storage of intermediate results in a decoherence-free subspace by simply applying Pauli \$X\$ matrices. The approach to logical gate synthesis taken in prior work focuses on the code states, and results in sufficient conditions for a CSS code to be fixed by a transversal \$Z\$-rotation. In contrast, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions by analyzing the action of a transversal diagonal gate on the stabilizer group that determines the code. The power of our approach is demonstrated by two proofs of concept: the \$[[2{\textasciicircum}\{l+1\}-2,2,2]]\$ triorthogonal code family, and the \$[[2{\textasciicircum}m,{\textbackslash}binom\{m\}\{r\},2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}min{\textbackslash}\{r,m-r{\textbackslash}\}\}]]\$ quantum Reed-Muller code family.},

To obtain high performance with these architectures, we require a decoder which can adapt to the wide variety of error models present in experiments. The typical approach to the problem of decoding the surface code is to reduce it to minimum-weight perfect matching in a way that provides a suboptimal threshold error rate, and is specialized to correct a specific error model. Recently, optimal threshold error rates for a variety of error models have been obtained by methods which do not use minimum-weight perfect matching, showing that such thresholds can be achieved in polynomial time. It is an open question whether these results can also be achieved by minimum-weight perfect matching. In this work, we use belief propagation and a novel algorithm for producing edge weights to increase the utility of minimum-weight perfect matching for decoding surface codes. This allows us to correct depolarizing errors using the rotated surface code, obtaining a threshold of \$17.76 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02 {\textbackslash}\%\$. This is larger than the threshold achieved by previous matching-based decoders (\$14.88 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02 {\textbackslash}\%\$), though still below the known upper bound of \${\textbackslash}sim 18.9 {\textbackslash}\%\$.},

We compare the performance of the message-passing algorithm to that of the widespread blockwise hard decoding technique. Our Monte Carlo results using the five-qubit and Steane’s code on a depolarizing channel demonstrate significant advantages of the message-passing algorithms in two respects: (i) Optimal decoding increases by as much as 94\% the error threshold below which the error correction procedure can be used to reliably send information over a noisy channel; and (ii) for noise levels below these thresholds, the probability of error after optimal decoding is suppressed at a significantly higher rate, leading to a substantial reduction of the error correction overhead.},

For Pauli channels, this task can be accomplished by a version of the belief propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse classical codes. Quantum codes pose two new challenges however. Firstly, their Tanner graph unavoidably contain small loops which typically undermines the performance of belief propagation. Secondly, sparse quantum codes are by definition highly degenerate. The standard belief propagation algorithm does not exploit this feature, but rather it is impaired by it. We propose heuristic methods to improve belief propagation decoding, specifically targeted at these two problems.

Here, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the performance and the potential of this protocol. Our strategy is based on analytically integrating out the gauge bosons, which preserves exact gauge invariance but results in complicated long-range interactions between the matter fields. Trapped-ion platforms are naturally suited to implementing these interactions, allowing for an efficient quantum simulation of the model, with a number of gate operations that scales only polynomially with system size. Employing numerical simulations, we illustrate that relevant phenomena can be observed in larger experimental systems, using as an example the production of particle--antiparticle pairs after a quantum quench. We investigate theoretically the robustness of the scheme towards generic error sources, and show that near-future experiments can reach regimes where finite-size effects are insignificant. We also discuss the challenges in quantum simulating the continuum limit of the theory. Using our scheme, fundamental phenomena of lattice gauge theories can be probed using a broad set of experimentally accessible observables, including the entanglement entropy and the vacuum persistence amplitude.},

Here, we present a decoding algorithm for topological codes that is faster than previously known algorithms and applies to a wider class of topological codes. Our algorithm makes use of two methods inspired from statistical physics: renormalization groups and mean-field approximations. First, the topological code is approximated by a concatenated block code that can be efficiently decoded. To improve this approximation, additional consistency conditions are imposed between the blocks, and are solved by a belief propagation algorithm.},

In this paper we describe a procedure for deriving the map between physical and effective channels that results from a given coding and recovery procedure. We show that the map for a concatenation of codes is given by the composition of the maps for the constituent codes. This perspective leads us to an efficient means for calculating the exact performance of quantum codes with arbitrary levels of concatenation. We present explicit results for single-bit Pauli channels. For certain codes under the symmetric depolarizing channel, we use the coding maps to compute exact threshold error probabilities for achievability of perfect fidelity in the infinite concatenation limit.},

	abstract = {The most general method for encoding quantum information is not to encode the information into a subspace of a Hilbert space, but to encode information into a subsystem of a Hilbert space. Recently this notion has led to a more general notion of quantum error correction known as operator quantum error correction. In standard quantum error correcting codes, one requires the ability to apply a procedure which exactly reverses on the error correcting subspace any correctable error. In contrast, for operator error correcting subsystems, the correction procedure need not undo the error which has occurred, but instead one must perform correction only modulo the subsystem structure. This does not lead to codes which differ from subspace codes, but does lead to recovery routines which explicitly make use of the subsystem structure. Here we present two examples of such operator error correcting subsystems. These examples are motivated by simple spatially local Hamiltonians on square and cubic lattices. In three dimensions we provide evidence, in the form a simple mean field theory, that our Hamiltonian gives rise to a system which is self-correcting. Such a system will be a natural high-temperature quantum memory, robust to noise without external intervening quantum error correction procedures.},

Consider also a quantum algorithm \${\textbackslash}mathcal A\$ such that \$A {\textbar}0{\textbackslash}rangle= {\textbackslash}sum\_\{x{\textbackslash}in X\} {\textbackslash}alpha\_x {\textbar}x{\textbackslash}rangle\$ is a quantum superposition of the elements of \$X\$, and let \$a\$ denote the probability that a good element is produced if \$A {\textbar}0{\textbackslash}rangle\$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running \$A\$, measuring the output, and using \${\textbackslash}chi\$ to check the validity of the result, we shall expect to repeat \$1/a\$ times on the average before a solution is found. *Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good \$x\$ after an expected number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{a\}\$, assuming algorithm \$A\$ makes no measurements. This is a generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which \$A\$ was restricted to producing an equal superposition of all members of \$X\$ and we had a promise that a single \$x\$ existed such that \${\textbackslash}chi(x)=1\$. Our algorithm works whether or not the value of \$a\$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of \$a\$ is known, we can find a good \$x\$ after a number of applications of \$A\$ and its inverse which is proportional to \$1/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{a\}\$ even in the worst case. We show that this quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of \$a\$. We apply amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish to estimate the number of \$x{\textbackslash}in X\$ such that \${\textbackslash}chi(x)=1\$. We obtain optimal quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.},

This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems.

Fortunately, some errors of different weights are logically equivalent and the same correction procedure is applicable to all equivalent errors, thus correcting high-weight errors is sometimes possible. In this work, we introduce a technique called weight parity error correction (WPEC) which can correct Pauli error of any weight in some stabilizer codes provided that the parity of the weight of the error is known. We show that the technique is applicable to concatenated codes constructed from the [[7,1,3]] Steane code or the [[23,1,7]] Golay code. We also provide a fault-tolerant error correction protocol using WPEC for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code which can correct up to 3 faults and requires only 2 ancillas.},

	abstract = {We present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for the Hidden Subgroup Problem over \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{D\}\_\{2{\textasciicircum}n\}\$. The usual approach to the Hidden Subgroup Problem relies on harmonic analysis in the domain of the problem, and the best known algorithm using this approach has time complexity in \$2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\})\}\$. By focusing on structure encoded in the codomain of the problem, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm which uses this structure to direct a "walk" down the subgroup lattice of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{D\}\_\{2{\textasciicircum}n\}\$ terminating at the hidden subgroup.},

	abstract = {In order to perform universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, one needs to implement a logical non-Clifford gate. Consequently, it is important to understand codes that implement such gates transversally. In this paper, we adopt an algebraic approach to characterize all stabilizer codes for which transversal \$T\$ and \$T{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ gates preserve the codespace. Our Heisenberg perspective reduces this to a finite geometry problem that translates to the design of certain classical codes. We prove three corollaries: (a) For any non-degenerate \$[[ n,k,d ]]\$ stabilizer code supporting a physical transversal \$T\$, there exists an \$[[ n,k,d ]]\$ CSS code with the same property; (b) Triorthogonal codes are the most general CSS codes that realize logical transversal \$T\$ via physical transversal \$T\$; (c) Triorthogonality is necessary for physical transversal \$T\$ on a CSS code to realize the logical identity. The main tool we use is a recent efficient characterization of certain diagonal gates in the Clifford hierarchy (arXiv:1902.04022). We refer to these gates as Quadratic Form Diagonal (QFD) gates. Our framework generalizes all existing code constructions that realize logical gates via transversal \$T\$. We provide several examples and briefly discuss connections to decreasing monomial codes, pin codes, generalized triorthogonality and quasitransversality. We partially extend these results towards characterizing all stabilizer codes that support transversal \${\textbackslash}pi/2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell\}\$ \$Z\$-rotations. In particular, using Ax's theorem on residue weights of polynomials, we provide an alternate characterization of logical gates induced by transversal \${\textbackslash}pi/2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}ell\}\$ \$Z\$-rotations on a family of quantum Reed-Muller codes. We also briefly discuss a general approach to analyze QFD gates that might lead to a characterization of all stabilizer codes that support any given physical transversal \$1\$- or \$2\$-local diagonal gate.},

From Monte-Carlo simulations, we identify experimental parameters for which these layouts admit reliable computation. Due to its low resource cost and superior performance, we conclude that the 17-qubit layout should be targeted in early experimental implementations of the surface code. We find that architectures with gate times in the 5-40 ns range and T1 times of at least 1-2 us range will exhibit improved logical error rates with a 17-qubit surface code encoding.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00197},
	abstract = {Physical platforms such as trapped ions suffer from coherent noise where errors manifest as rotations about a particular axis and can accumulate over time. We investigate passive mitigation through decoherence free subspaces, requiring the noise to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, and to act as the logical identity operator on the protected information. Thus, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for all transversal \$Z\$-rotations to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, which require the weight-\$2\$ \$Z\$-stabilizers to cover all the qubits that are in the support of some \$X\$-component. Further, the weight-\$2\$ \$Z\$-stabilizers generate a direct product of single-parity-check codes with even block length. By adjusting the size of these components, we are able to construct a large family of QECC codes, oblivious to coherent noise, that includes the \$[[4L{\textasciicircum}2, 1, 2L]]\$ Shor codes. Moreover, given \$M\$ even and any \$[[n,k,d]]\$ stabilizer code, we can construct an \$[[Mn, k, {\textbackslash}ge d]]\$ stabilizer code that is oblivious to coherent noise. If we require that transversal \$Z\$-rotations preserve the code space only up to some finite level \$l\$ in the Clifford hierarchy, then we can construct higher level gates necessary for universal quantum computation. The \$Z\$-stabilizers supported on each non-zero \$X\$-component form a classical binary code C, which is required to contain a self-dual code, and the classical Gleason's theorem constrains its weight enumerator. The conditions for a stabilizer code being preserved by transversal \$2{\textbackslash}pi/2{\textasciicircum}l\$ \$Z\$-rotations at \$4 {\textbackslash}le l {\textbackslash}le l\_\{{\textbackslash}max\} {\textless}{\textbackslash}infty\$ level in the Clifford hierarchy lead to generalizations of Gleason's theorem that may be of independent interest to classical coding theorists.},

A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of decoherence-free (noiseless) subsystems in the Markovian regime is derived here for the first time. A stabilizer formalism for DFSs is then developed which allows for the explicit understanding of these in their dual role as quantum error correcting codes. Conditions for the existence of Hamiltonians whose induced evolution always preserves a DFS are derived within this stabilizer formalism. Two possible collective decoherence mechanisms arising from permutation symmetries of the system-bath coupling are examined within this framework. It is shown that in both cases universal quantum computation which always preserves the DFS (*natural fault-tolerant computation*) can be performed using only two-body interactions. This is in marked contrast to standard error correcting codes, where all known constructions using one or two-body interactions must leave the codespace during the on-time of the fault-tolerant gates. A further consequence of our universality construction is that a single exchange Hamiltonian can be used to perform universal quantum computation on an encoded space whose asymptotic coding efficiency is unity. The exchange Hamiltonian, which is naturally present in many quantum systems, is thus *asymptotically universal*.},

The thesis was submitted in 1902 in G¨ottingen, during a period of dramatic developments in physics. Ritz tried to explain the phenomenon of Balmer series in spectroscopy using eigenvalue problems of partial diﬀerential equations on rectangular domains. While this physical model quickly turned out to be completely obsolete, his mathematics later enabled him to solve diﬃcult problems in applied sciences. He thereby revolutionized the variational calculus and became one of the fathers of modern computational mathematics.

	abstract = {We significantly reduce the cost of factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms in finite fields on a quantum computer by combining techniques from Shor 1994, Griffiths-Niu 1996, Zalka 2006, Fowler 2012, Eker\{{\textbackslash}aa\}-H\{{\textbackslash}aa\}stad 2017, Eker\{{\textbackslash}aa\} 2017, Eker\{{\textbackslash}aa\} 2018, Gidney-Fowler 2019, Gidney 2019. We estimate the approximate cost of our construction using plausible physical assumptions for large-scale superconducting qubit platforms: a planar grid of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity, a characteristic physical gate error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, a surface code cycle time of 1 microsecond, and a reaction time of 10 microseconds. We account for factors that are normally ignored such as noise, the need to make repeated attempts, and the spacetime layout of the computation. When factoring 2048 bit RSA integers, our construction's spacetime volume is a hundredfold less than comparable estimates from earlier works (Van Meter et al. 2009, Jones et al. 2010, Fowler et al. 2012, Gheorghiu et al. 2019). In the abstract circuit model (which ignores overheads from distillation, routing, and error correction) our construction uses \$3 n + 0.002 n {\textbackslash}lg n\$ logical qubits, \$0.3 n{\textasciicircum}3 + 0.0005 n{\textasciicircum}3 {\textbackslash}lg n\$ Toffolis, and \$500 n{\textasciicircum}2 + n{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}lg n\$ measurement depth to factor \$n\$-bit RSA integers. We quantify the cryptographic implications of our work, both for RSA and for schemes based on the DLP in finite fields.},

However, previous bounds on the measurement time required have suggested that the application of these techniques to larger molecules might be infeasible. We present a measurement strategy based on a low-rank factorization of the two-electron integral tensor. Our approach provides a cubic reduction in term groupings over prior state-of-the-art and enables measurement times three orders of magnitude smaller than those suggested by commonly referenced bounds for the largest systems we consider. Although our technique requires execution of a linear-depth circuit prior to measurement, this is compensated for by eliminating challenges associated with sampling nonlocal Jordan–Wigner transformed operators in the presence of measurement error, while enabling a powerful form of error mitigation based on efficient postselection. We numerically characterize these benefits with noisy quantum circuit simulations for ground-state energies of strongly correlated electronic systems.},

While quantum processors may be built as two-dimensional qubit networks with couplings between nearest neighbors, standard Fermion-to-qubit mappings do not account for that kind of connectivity. In this work we concatenate the (one-dimensional) Jordan-Wigner transform with specific quantum codes defined under the addition of a certain number of auxiliary qubits. This yields a novel class of mappings with which any fermionic system can be embedded in a two-dimensional qubit setup, fostering scalable quantum simulation. Our technique is demonstrated on the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, that we transform into a local Hamiltonian. What is more, we adapt the Verstraete-Cirac transform and Bravyi-Kitaev Superfast simulation to the square lattice connectivity and compare them to our mappings. An advantage of our approach in this comparison is that it allows us to encode and decode a logical state with a simple unitary quantum circuit.},

	abstract = {The quantum simulation of quantum chemistry is a promising application of quantum computers. However, for N molecular orbitals, the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}4)\$ gate complexity of performing Hamiltonian and unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter steps makes simulation based on such primitives challenging. We substantially reduce the gate complexity of such primitives through a two-step low-rank factorization of the Hamiltonian and cluster operator, accompanied by truncation of small terms. Using truncations that incur errors below chemical accuracy, we are able to perform Trotter steps of the arbitrary basis electronic structure Hamiltonian with \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}3)\$ gate complexity in small simulations, which reduces to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}log N)\$ gate complexity in the asymptotic regime, while our unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter step has \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}3)\$ gate complexity as a function of increasing basis size for a given molecule. In the case of the Hamiltonian Trotter step, these circuits have \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ depth on a linearly connected array, an improvement over the \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}3)\$ scaling assuming no truncation. As a practical example, we show that a chemically accurate Hamiltonian Trotter step for a 50 qubit molecular simulation can be carried out in the molecular orbital basis with as few as 4,000 layers of parallel nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates, consisting of fewer than 100,000 non-Clifford rotations. We also apply our algorithm to iron-sulfur clusters relevant for elucidating the mode of action of metalloenzymes.},

Here we study a closely related quantum field-theoretical problem: estimating the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude, in the presence of spacetime-dependent classical sources, for a massive scalar field theory in (1+1) dimensions. We show that this problem is BQP-hard; in other words, its solution enables one to solve any problem that is solvable in polynomial time by a quantum computer. Hence, the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude cannot be accurately estimated by any efficient classical algorithm, even if the field theory is very weakly coupled, unless BQP=BPP. Furthermore, the corresponding decision problem can be solved by a quantum computer in a time scaling polynomially with the number of bits needed to specify the classical source fields, and this problem is therefore BQP-complete. Our construction can be regarded as an idealized architecture for a universal quantum computer in a laboratory system described by massive phi{\textasciicircum}4 theory coupled to classical spacetime-dependent sources.},

This opportunity motivates reconsidering the Hamiltonian formulation of gauge theories, with a suitable truncation scheme to render the Hilbert space finite-dimensional. Conventional formulations lead to a Hilbert space largely spanned by unphysical states; given the current inability to perform large scale quantum computations, we examine here how one might restrict wave function evolution entirely or mostly to the physical subspace. We consider such constructions for the simplest of these theories containing dynamical gauge bosons -- U(1) lattice gauge theory without matter in \$d=2,3\$ spatial dimensions -- and find that electric-magnetic duality naturally plays an important role. We conclude that this approach is likely to significantly reduce computational overhead in \$d=2\$ by a reduction of variables and by allowing one to regulate magnetic fluctuations instead of electric. The former advantage does not exist in \$d=3\$, but the latter might be important for asymptotically-free gauge theories.},

Unlike existing work on detecting violations of Gauss' law, our circuits are fault tolerant and the overall error correction scheme outperforms a na{\textbackslash}"\{i\}ve application of the \$[5,1,3]\$ code. The constructions outlined can be extended to LGT systems with larger cutoffs and may be of use in understanding how to hybridize error correction and quantum simulation for LGTs in higher space-time dimensions and with different symmetry groups.},

While fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are not yet realized, there may exist intermediate forms of error correction that enable practical applications. In this work, we consider the idea of post-processing error decoders using existing quantum codes, which mitigate errors on logical qubits using post-processing without explicit syndrome measurements or additional qubits beyond the encoding overhead. This greatly simplifies the experimental exploration of quantum codes on real, near-term devices, removing the need for locality of syndromes or fast feed-forward. We develop the theory of the method and demonstrate it on an example with the perfect [[5, 1, 3]] code, which exhibits a pseudo-threshold of p ≈ 0.50 under a single qubit depolarizing channel applied to all qubits. We also provide a demonstration of improved performance on an unencoded hydrogen molecule.},

	abstract = {Fermion-to-qubit mappings that preserve geometric locality are especially useful for simulating lattice fermion models (e.g., the Hubbard model) on a quantum computer. They avoid the overhead associated with geometric nonlocal parity terms in mappings such as the Jordan-Wigner transformation and the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. As a result, they often provide quantum circuits with lower depth and gate complexity. In such encodings, fermionic states are encoded in the common +1 eigenspace of a set of stabilizers, akin to stabilizer quantum error-correcting codes. Here, we discuss several known geometric locality-preserving mappings and their abilities to correct and detect single-qubit errors. We introduce a geometric locality-preserving map, whose stabilizers correspond to products of Majorana operators on closed paths of the fermionic hopping graph. We show that our code, which we refer to as the Majorana loop stabilizer code (MLSC) can correct all single-qubit errors on a two-dimensional square lattice, while previous geometric locality-preserving codes can only detect single-qubit errors on the same lattice. Compared to existing codes, the MLSC maps the relevant fermionic operators to lower-weight qubit operators despite having higher code distance. Going beyond lattice models, we demonstrate that the MLSC is compatible with state-of-the-art algorithms for simulating quantum chemistry, and can offer those simulations the same error-correction properties without additional asymptotic overhead. These properties make the MLSC a promising candidate for error-mitigated quantum simulations of fermions on near-term devices.},

	abstract = {We discuss encodings of fermionic many-body systems by qubits in the presence of symmetries. Such encodings eliminate redundant degrees of freedom in a way that preserves a simple structure of the system Hamiltonian enabling quantum simulations with fewer qubits. First we consider \$U(1)\$ symmetry describing the particle number conservation. Using a previously known encoding based on the first quantization method a system of \$M\$ fermi modes with \$N\$ particles can be simulated on a quantum computer with \$Q=N{\textbackslash}log\{(M)\}\$ qubits. We propose a new version of this encoding tailored to variational quantum algorithms. Also we show how to improve sparsity of the simulator Hamiltonian using orthogonal arrays. Next we consider encodings based on the second quantization method. It is shown that encodings with a given filling fraction \${\textbackslash}nu=N/M\$ and a qubit-per-mode ratio \${\textbackslash}eta=Q/M{\textless}1\$ can be constructed from efficiently decodable classical LDPC codes with the relative distance \$2{\textbackslash}nu\$ and the encoding rate \$1-{\textbackslash}eta\$. A family of codes based on high-girth bipartite graphs is discussed. Graph-based encodings eliminate roughly \$M/N\$ qubits. Finally we consider discrete symmetries, and show how to eliminate qubits using previously known encodings, illustrating the technique for simple molecular-type Hamiltonians.},

	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE) uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits. The VQE may be used to model complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims to provide an overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail including representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process, the post-processing mitigation of errors, and best practices are suggested. We identify four main areas of future research:(1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers;(3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.},

	abstract = {Simulating fermionic systems on a quantum computer requires a high-performing mapping of fermionic states to qubits. The key characteristic of an efficient mapping is its ability to translate local fermionic interactions into qubit interactions. This has strong implications both on the number of qubits as well as the gate cost of simulations. We introduce a novel way to optimise fermion-qubit mappings by studying fermionic enumeration schemes. Finding an efficient enumeration scheme allows one to increase the locality of the target qubit Hamiltonian without expending any additional resources. The problem of finding optimal arrangements for a general fermionic connectivity graph is NP-complete. We find optimal enumeration schemes for fermionic lattices, which leads to qubit Hamiltonians with terms using 13.9\% less gates than in previous methods. We also find efficient enumeration designs for a range of other practical connectivities where for \$n\$ fermions we achieve \$n{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\}\$ improvement. A further advantage of our scheme for fermionic lattices is that by adding only two ancilla qubits we can reduce the average gate count of Hamiltonian terms by a full 40\% compared to previous methods.},

This overhead can be a hindrance to implementation of qubit-based quantum simulators, especially in the analog context. Here we thus review and analyze alternative fermion-to-qubit mappings, including the two approaches by Bravyi and Kitaev and the Auxiliary Fermion transformation. The Bravyi-Kitaev transform is reformulated in terms of a classical data structure and generalized to achieve a further locality improvement for local fermionic models on a rectangular lattice. We conclude that the most compact encoding of the fermionic operators can be done using ancilla qubits with the Auxiliary Fermion scheme. Without introducing ancillas, a variant of the Bravyi-Kitaev transform provides the most compact fermion-to-qubit mapping for Hubbard-like models.},

The resulting formalism is valid for any prime-dimensional quantum system. The modified decoder works for any stabilizer code \$S\$ and separates into two parts: a one-time, offline computation which builds a compact, graphical representation of the normalizer of the code, \$S{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}perp\$, and a quick, parallel, online query of the resulting vertices using the Viterbi algorithm. We show the utility of trellis decoding by applying it to four high-density, length 20 stabilizer codes for depolarizing noise and the well-studied Steane, rotated surface, and 4.8.8/6.6.6 color codes for \$Z\$-only noise. Numerical simulations demonstrate a 20{\textbackslash}\% improvement in the code-capacity threshold for color codes with boundaries by avoiding the mapping from color codes to surface codes.

At the level of fault-tolerant encoding, one likely requirement of this process is the translation into a topological circuit, for which braided circuits represent one candidate model. Given the large overhead associated with encoded circuits, it is paramount to reduce their size in terms of computation time and qubit number through circuit compression. While these optimizations have typically been performed in the language of three-dimensional diagrams, such a representation does not allow an efficient, general, and scalable approach to reduction or verification. We propose the use of the ZX-calculus as an intermediate language for braided circuit compression, demonstrating advantage by comparing results using this approach with those previously obtained for the compression of A- and Y-state distillation circuits. We then provide a benchmark of our method against a small set of Clifford+T circuits, yielding compression percentages of 77\%. Our results suggest that the overheads of braided, defect-based circuits are comparable to those of their lattice-surgery counterparts, restoring the potential of this model for surface-code quantum computation.},

	abstract = {We define a model of quantum computation with local fermionic modes (LFMs) -- sites which can be either empty or occupied by a fermion. With the standard correspondence between the Foch space of \$m\$ LFMs and the Hilbert space of \$m\$ qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes \$O(m)\$ qubit gates and vice versa. We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to \$O({\textbackslash}log m)\$ and a constant, respectively. Nearest-neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a constant cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found. We also study computation with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of LFMs. Some connection to qubit quantum codes is made.},

	abstract = {Because Majorana zero modes store quantum information nonlocally, they are protected from noise, and have been proposed as a building block for a quantum computer. We show how to use the same protection from noise to implement universal fermionic quantum computation. Our architecture requires only two Majorana modes to encode a fermionic quantum degree of freedom, compared to alternative implementations which require a minimum of four Majorana modes for a spin quantum degree of freedom. The fermionic degrees of freedom support both unitary coupled cluster variational quantum eigensolver and quantum phase estimation algorithms, proposed for quantum chemistry simulations. Because we avoid the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our scheme has a lower overhead for implementing both of these algorithms, allowing for simulation of the Trotterized Hubbard Hamiltonian in O(1) time per unitary step. We finally demonstrate magic state distillation in our fermionic architecture, giving a universal set of topologically protected fermionic quantum gates.},

	abstract = {Simulation of fermionic many-body systems on a quantum computer requires a suitable encoding of fermionic degrees of freedom into qubits. Here we revisit the Superfast Encoding introduced by Kitaev and one of the authors. This encoding maps a target fermionic Hamiltonian with two-body interactions on a graph of degree \$d\$ to a qubit simulator Hamiltonian composed of Pauli operators of weight \$O(d)\$. A system of \$m\$ fermi modes gets mapped to \$n=O(md)\$ qubits. We propose Generalized Superfast Encodings (GSE) which require the same number of qubits as the original one but have more favorable properties. First, we describe a GSE such that the corresponding quantum code corrects any single-qubit error provided that the interaction graph has degree \$d{\textbackslash}ge 6\$. In contrast, we prove that the original Superfast Encoding lacks the error correction property for \$d{\textbackslash}le 6\$. Secondly, we describe a GSE that reduces the Pauli weight of the simulator Hamiltonian from \$O(d)\$ to \$O({\textbackslash}log\{d\})\$. The robustness against errors and a simplified structure of the simulator Hamiltonian offered by GSEs can make simulation of fermionic systems within the reach of near-term quantum devices. As an example, we apply the new encoding to the fermionic Hubbard model on a 2D lattice.},

Our proposed architecture designs have the following principal virtues: (1) the magnetic field can be aligned in the direction of all of the topological superconducting wires since they are all parallel; (2) topological \$T\$-junctions are not used, obviating possible difficulties in their fabrication and utilization; (3) quasiparticle poisoning is abated by the charging energy; (4) Clifford operations are executed by a relatively standard measurement: detection of corrections to quantum dot energy, charge, or differential capacitance induced by quantum fluctuations; (5) it is compatible with strategies for producing good approximate magic states.},

We demonstrate the flexibility of C-IBS by providing efficient solutions that optimize error correction, helper data size or decoder complexity for a well-known key generation scenario. Further, we present encoding criteria that characterize C-IBS fuzzy embedders in general. A hardware implementation is compared to previous work and substantiates the efficiency of C-IBS.

One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t){\textasciicircum}c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.},

	abstract = {We prove a new version of the quantum threshold theorem that applies to concatenation of a quantum code that corrects only one error, and we use this theorem to derive a rigorous lower bound on the quantum accuracy threshold epsilon\_0. Our proof also applies to concatenation of higher-distance codes, and to noise models that allow faults to be correlated in space and in time. The proof uses new criteria for assessing the accuracy of fault-tolerant circuits, which are particularly conducive to the inductive analysis of recursive simulations. Our lower bound on the threshold, epsilon\_0 {\textgreater} 2.73 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\} for an adversarial independent stochastic noise model, is derived from a computer-assisted combinatorial analysis; it is the best lower bound that has been rigorously proven so far.},

Starting from a Hamiltonian formulation of realistic noise models, and assuming that QEC is indeed possible, we find formal expressions for the probability of a faulty path and the residual decoherence encoded in the reduced density matrix. Systems with non-zero gate times (``long gates'') are included in our analysis by using an upper bound on the noise. In order to introduce the local error probability for a qubit, we assume that propagation of signals through the environment is slower than the QEC period (hypercube assumption). This allows an explicit calculation in the case of a generalized spin-boson model and a quantum frustration model. The key result is a dimensional criterion: If the correlations decay sufficiently fast, the system evolves toward a stochastic error model for which the threshold theorem of fault-tolerant quantum computation has been proven. On the other hand, if the correlations decay slowly, the traditional proof of this threshold theorem does not hold. This dimensional criterion bears many similarities to criteria that occur in the theory of quantum phase transitions.},

	abstract = {This paper proves the threshold result, which asserts that quantum computation can be made robust against errors and inaccuracies, when the error rate, \${\textbackslash}eta\$, is smaller than a constant threshold, \${\textbackslash}eta\_c\$. The result holds for a very general, not necessarily probabilistic noise model, for quantum particles with any number of states, and is also generalized to one dimensional quantum computers with only nearest neighbor interactions. No measurements, or classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. The proceeding version was very succinct, and here we fill all the missing details, and elaborate on many parts of the proof. In particular, we devote a section for a discussion of universality issues and proofs that the sets of gates that we use are universal. Another section is devoted to a rigorous proof that fault tolerance can be achieved in the presence of general non probabilistic noise. The systematic structure of the fault tolerant procedures for polynomial codes is explained in length. The proof that the concatenation scheme works is written in a clearer way. The paper also contains new and significantly simpler proofs for most of the known results which we use. For example, we give a simple proof that it suffices to correct bit and phase flips, we significantly simplify Calderbank and Shor's original proof of the correctness of CSS codes. We also give a simple proof of the fact that two-qubit gates are universal. The paper thus provides a self contained and complete proof for universal fault tolerant quantum computation.},

Since quantum superpositions are fragile, the major hurdle in building such a computer is overcoming noise. Developed over the last couple of years, new schemes for achieving fault tolerance based on error detection, rather than error correction, appear to tolerate as much as 3-6\% noise per gate -- an order of magnitude better than previous procedures. But proof techniques could not show that these promising fault-tolerance schemes tolerated any noise at all. With an analysis based on decomposing complicated probability distributions into mixtures of simpler ones, we rigorously prove the existence of constant tolerable noise rates ("noise thresholds") for error-detection-based schemes. Numerical calculations indicate that the actual noise threshold this method yields is lower-bounded by 0.1\% noise per gate.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a physical mapping tool for quantum circuits, which generates the optimal Universal Logic Block (ULB) that can perform any logical fault-tolerant (FT) quantum operations with the minimum latency. The operation scheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum physical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the scheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution due to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation scheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions influence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between predecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies. The proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies by applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum data flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the quantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified force-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and quantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven instruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while making iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct scheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step that finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to the quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single best ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of different FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using information about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of the target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.},

Encoded quantum information can be protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10{\textasciicircum}6 qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}, would be a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller, less accurate quantum computer would be able to perform many useful tasks.

Instead, decoding QECCs can be very much different from decoding classical codes due to the degeneracy property. Intuitively, one expect degeneracy would simplify the decoding since two different errors might not and need not be distinguished in order to correct them. However, we show that general quantum decoding problem is NP-hard regardless of the quantum codes being degenerate or non-degenerate. This finding implies that no considerably fast decoding algorithm exists for the general quantum decoding problems, and suggests the existence of a quantum cryptosystem based on the hardness of decoding QECCs.},

The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

We find optimal pulse sequences consisting of L primitive π or 2π rotations that suppress such errors to arbitrary order O(εn) on arbitrary initial states. Optimality is demonstrated by proving an L=O(n) lower bound and saturating it with L=2n solutions. Closed-form solutions for arbitrary rotation angles are given for n=1,2,3,4. Perturbative solutions for any n are proven for small angles, while arbitrary angle solutions are obtained by analytic continuation up to n=12.

We develop a new “Quantum singular value transformation” algorithm that can directly harness the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized by quantum circuits with a very simple structure - typically using only a constant number of ancilla qubits - leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors. We show that our framework allows describing many quantum algorithms on a high level, and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to various quantum machine learning applications. We also devise a new singular vector transformation algorithm, describe how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum, and show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. Finally, we also prove a quantum lower bound on spectral transformations.},

Thus, composite pulses of overall flip angle 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, or, for example, 54.7°, can be written down in a matter of seconds. Composite pulses that, at exact resonance, exhibit either broadband, narrowband, or passband behavior with respect to the strength of the radiofrequency field are demonstrated. The performance of all these composite pulses remains satisfactory over a range of normalized resonance offsets typical of 1H NMR spectroscopy. The most significant feature of the new composite pulses presented in this paper, however, is that they can be used to replace a simple pulse at any point in an advanced NMR experiment without further modification of the pulse sequence.},

All single-qubit Pauli errors on the ancillary qubits propagate to form exclusively correctable errors on the data qubits. The situation changes for error models with two-qubit Pauli errors. We compare the level-1 logical error rates under two noise models: the standard Pauli symmetric depolarizing error model and an anisotropic error model. The anisotropic model is motivated by control errors on two-qubit gates commonly applied to trapped ion qubits. We find that one ancillary qubit per syndrome measurement is sufficient for fault-tolerance for the anisotropic error, but is not sufficient for the standard depolarizing errors. We then show how to achieve fault tolerance for the standard depolarizing errors by adding flag qubits to check for errors on select ancilary qubits. Our results on this [[7, 1, 3]] code demonstrates how physically motivated noise models may simplify fault-tolerent protocols.},

We present a fast new probabilistic algorithm for solving this problem optimally, i.e., for finding the shortest possible circuit whatsoever for the given problem instance. The algorithm requires a factoring oracle (such as a quantum computer). Even in the absence of a factoring oracle, the algorithm is still near-optimal under a mild number-theoretic hypothesis. In this case, the algorithm finds a solution of T-count m + O(log(log(1/epsilon))), where m is the T-count of the second-to-optimal solution. In the typical case, this yields circuit approximations of T-count 3log\_2(1/epsilon) + O(log(log(1/epsilon))). Our algorithm is efficient in practice, and provably efficient under the above-mentioned number-theoretic hypothesis, in the sense that its expected runtime is O(polylog(1/epsilon)).},

	abstract = {Surface codes are building blocks of quantum computing platforms based on 2D arrays of qubits responsible for detecting and correcting errors. The error suppression achieved by the surface code is usually estimated by simulating toy noise models describing random Pauli errors. However, Pauli noise models fail to capture coherent processes such as systematic unitary errors caused by imperfect control pulses. Here we report the first large-scale simulation of quantum error correction protocols based on the surface code in the presence of coherent noise. We observe that the standard Pauli approximation provides an accurate estimate of the error threshold but underestimates the logical error rate in the sub-threshold regime. We find that for large code size the logical-level noise is well approximated by random Pauli errors even though the physical-level noise is coherent. Our work demonstrates that coherent effects do not significantly change the error correcting threshold of surface codes. This gives more confidence in the viability of the fault-tolerance architecture pursued by several experimental groups.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10145},
	abstract = {We employ an algebraic procedure based on quantum mechanics to propose a `quantum number theory' (QNT) as a possible extension of the `classical number theory'. We built our QNT by defining pure quantum number operators (\$q\$-numbers) of a Hilbert space that generate classical numbers (\$c\$-numbers) belonging to discrete Euclidean spaces. To start with this formalism, we define a 2-component natural \$q\$-number \${\textbackslash}textbf\{N\}\$, such that \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{N\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}equiv N\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} + N\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$, satisfying a Heisenberg-Dirac algebra, which allows to generate a set of natural \$c\$-numbers \$n {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\}\$. A probabilistic interpretation of QNT is then inferred from this representation. Furthermore, we define a 3-component integer \$q\$-number \${\textbackslash}textbf\{Z\}\$, such that \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}equiv Z\_\{1\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} + Z\_\{2\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} + Z\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ and obeys a Lie algebra structure. The eigenvalues of each \${\textbackslash}textbf\{Z\}\$ component generate a set of classical integers \$m {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textbackslash}cup {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}{\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\} = {\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\} {\textbackslash}setminus {\textbackslash}\{0{\textbackslash}\}\$, albeit all components do not generate \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ simultaneously. We interpret the eigenvectors of the \$q\$-numbers as `\$q\$-number state vectors' (QNSV), which form multidimensional orthonormal basis sets useful to describe state-vector superpositions defined here as qu\$n\$its. To interconnect QNSV of different dimensions, associated to the same \$c\$-number, we propose a quantum mapping operation to relate distinct Hilbert subspaces, and its structure can generate a subset \$W {\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}mathbb\{Q\}{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$, the field of non-zero rationals. In the present description, QNT is related to quantum computing theory and allows dealing with nontrivial computations in high dimensions.},

Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers - the difficulty of describing them on classical computers - also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

Accordingly, the possibility of quantum enhanced optimization has driven much interest in quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate the application of the Google Sycamore superconducting qubit quantum processor to combinatorial optimization problems with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Like past QAOA experiments, we study performance for problems defined on the planar connectivity graph native to our hardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model and MaxCut, non-native problems that require extensive compilation to implement. For hardware-native problems, which are classically efficient to solve on average, we obtain an approximation ratio that is independent of problem size and observe that performance increases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance decreases with problem size. Circuits involving several thousand gates still present an advantage over random guessing but not over some efficient classical algorithms. Our results suggest that it will be challenging to scale near-term implementations of the QAOA for problems on non-native graphs. As these graphs are closer to real-world instances, we suggest more emphasis should be placed on such problems when using the QAOA to benchmark quantum processors.},

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

	abstract = {We present the problem of approximating the time-evolution operator \$e{\textasciicircum}\{-i{\textbackslash}hat\{H\}t\}\$ to error \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, where the Hamiltonian \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}=({\textbackslash}langle G{\textbar}{\textbackslash}otimes{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\}){\textbackslash}hat\{U\}({\textbar}G{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}otimes{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\})\$ is the projection of a unitary oracle \${\textbackslash}hat\{U\}\$ onto the state \${\textbar}G{\textbackslash}rangle\$ created by another unitary oracle. Our algorithm solves this with a query complexity \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}{\textbackslash}big(t+{\textbackslash}log(\{1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\}){\textbackslash}big)\$ to both oracles that is optimal with respect to all parameters in both the asymptotic and non-asymptotic regime, and also with low overhead, using at most two additional ancilla qubits. This approach to Hamiltonian simulation subsumes important prior art considering Hamiltonians which are \$d\$-sparse or a linear combination of unitaries, leading to significant improvements in space and gate complexity, such as a quadratic speed-up for precision simulations. It also motivates useful new instances, such as where \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ is a density matrix. A key technical result is `qubitization', which uses the controlled version of these oracles to embed any \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ in an invariant \${\textbackslash}text\{SU\}(2)\$ subspace. A large class of operator functions of \${\textbackslash}hat\{H\}\$ can then be computed with optimal query complexity, of which \$e{\textasciicircum}\{-i{\textbackslash}hat\{H\}t\}\$ is a special case.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is powerful because unitary operators describing the time-evolution of a quantum system have exponential size in terms of the number of qubits present in the system. We develop a new "Singular value transformation" algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage, that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and Chuang. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while usually only use a constant number of ancilla qubits. We show that singular value transformation leads to novel algorithms. We give an efficient solution to a certain "non-commutative" measurement problem and propose a new method for singular value estimation. We also show how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum. Finally, as a quantum machine learning application we show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. "Singular value transformation" is conceptually simple and efficient, and leads to a unified framework of quantum algorithms incorporating a variety of quantum speed-ups. We illustrate this by showing how it generalizes a number of prominent quantum algorithms, including: optimal Hamiltonian simulation, implementing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with exponential precision, fixed-point amplitude amplification, robust oblivious amplitude amplification, fast QMA amplification, fast quantum OR lemma, certain quantum walk results and several quantum machine learning algorithms. In order to exploit the strengths of the presented method it is useful to know its limitations too, therefore we also prove a lower bound on the efficiency of singular value transformation, which often gives optimal bounds.},

Although this task was not designed with a real application directly in mind, the LINPACK benchmark has been used to define the list of TOP500 supercomputers since the debut of the list in 1993. We propose that a similar benchmark, called the quantum LINPACK benchmark, could be used to measure the whole machine performance of quantum computers. The success of the quantum LINPACK benchmark should be viewed as the minimal requirement for a quantum computer to perform a useful task of solving linear algebra problems, such as linear systems of equations. We propose an input model called the RAndom Circuit Block-Encoded Matrix (RACBEM), which is a proper generalization of a dense random matrix in the quantum setting. The RACBEM model is efficient to be implemented on a quantum computer, and can be designed to optimally adapt to any given quantum architecture, with relying on a black-box quantum compiler. Besides solving linear systems, the RACBEM model can be used to perform a variety of linear algebra tasks relevant to many physical applications, such as computing spectral measures, time series generated by a Hamiltonian simulation, and thermal averages of the energy. We implement these linear algebra operations on IBM Q quantum devices as well as quantum virtual machines, and demonstrate their performance in solving scientific computing problems.},

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily{\textbackslash}'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.},

In particular, we construct a 16-state 12-section structurally invariant tail-biting trellis for the (24, 12, 8) binary Golay code. This tail-biting trellis representation is minimal: it simultaneously minimizes all conceivable measures of state complexity. Moreover, it compares favorably with the minimal conventional 12-section trellis for the Golay code, which has 256 states at its midpoint, or with the best quasi-cyclic representation of this code, which leads to a 64-state tail-biting trellis. Unwrapping this tail-biting trellis produces a periodically time-varying 16-state rate-1/2 "convolutional Golay code" with d=8, which has attractive performance/complexity properties. We furthermore show that the (6, 3, 4) quaternary hexacode has a minimal 8-state group tail-biting trellis, even though it has no such linear trellis over F/sub 4/.

In addition to extending flag error correction beyond distance-three codes for the first time, our protocol also applies to a broader class of distance-three codes than was previously known. Flag circuits use extra ancilla qubits to signal when errors resulting from \$v\$ faults in the circuit have weight greater than \$v\$. The flag error correction protocol is applicable to stabilizer codes of arbitrary distance which satisfy a set of conditions and uses fewer qubits than other schemes such as Shor, Steane and Knill error correction. We give examples of infinite code families which satisfy these conditions and analyze the behaviour of distance-three and -five examples numerically. Requiring fewer resources than Shor error correction, flag error correction could potentially be used in low-overhead fault-tolerant error correction protocols using low density parity check quantum codes of large code length.},

This family increases the complexity of ancilla construction in exchange for reducing the rounds of measurement required to fault-tolerantly measure the error. We then apply this construction to the toric code of size \$L{\textbackslash}times L\$ and find that blocks of size \$m{\textbackslash}times m\$ can be used to decode errors in \$O(L/m)\$ rounds of measurements.

Since quantum superpositions are fragile, the major hurdle in building such a computer is overcoming noise. Developed over the last couple of years, new schemes for achieving fault tolerance based on error detection, rather than error correction, appear to tolerate as much as 3-6\% noise per gate -- an order of magnitude better than previous procedures. But proof techniques could not show that these promising fault-tolerance schemes tolerated any noise at all. With an analysis based on decomposing complicated probability distributions into mixtures of simpler ones, we rigorously prove the existence of constant tolerable noise rates ("noise thresholds") for error-detection-based schemes. Numerical calculations indicate that the actual noise threshold this method yields is lower-bounded by 0.1\% noise per gate.},

However, the two-qubit error-correction technique, known as "flagged" syndrome extraction, works slowly, measuring only one syndrome at a time. This is a disadvantage in experiments with high qubit rest error rates. We extend the technique to extract multiple syndromes at once, without needing more qubits. Qubits for different syndromes can flag errors in each other. This gives equally fast and more qubit-efficient alternatives to Steane's error-correction method, and also conforms to planar geometry constraints. We further show that Steane's code and some others can be error-corrected with no extra qubits, provided there are at least two code blocks. The rough idea is that two seven-qubit codewords can be temporarily joined into a twelve-qubit code, freeing two qubits for flagged syndrome measurement.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06248},
	abstract = {Entanglement distillation is a well-studied problem in quantum information, where one typically starts with \$n\$ noisy Bell pairs and distills \$k\$ Bell pairs of higher fidelity. While distilling Bell pairs is the canonical setting, it is important to study the distillation of multipartite entangled states because these can be useful for realizing distributed algorithms on quantum networks. In this paper, we study the distillation of GHZ states using quantum error correcting codes (QECCs). Using the stabilizer formalism, we begin by explaining the QECC-based Bell pair distillation protocol in arXiv:0708.3699, which relies particularly on the transpose symmetry between Alice's and Bob's qubits in Bell states. Extending this idea, we show that, given \$n\$ GHZ states, performing a matrix on Alice's qubits is equivalent to performing a "stretched" version of the transpose of the matrix on the qubits of Bob and Charlie. We call this mapping to the stretched version of the matrix the GHZ-map, and show that it is an algebra homomorphism. Using this property, we show that Alice projecting her qubits onto an \$[[n,k]]\$ stabilizer code implies the simultaneous projection of Bob's and Charlie's qubits onto an induced \$[[2n,k]]\$ stabilizer code. Guided by this insight, we develop a GHZ distillation protocol based on local operations and classical communication that uses any stabilizer code. Inspired by stabilizer measurements on GHZ states, we also develop a new algorithm to generate logical Pauli operators of any stabilizer code and use it in the protocol. Since quantum codes with finite rate and almost linear minimum distance have recently been discovered, this paper paves the way for high-rate high-output-fidelity GHZ distillation. We provide simulation results on the \$5\$-qubit perfect code to emphasize the importance of the placement of a certain local Clifford operation in the protocol.},

This leads to a discussion of error correction in a quantum communication channel or a quantum computer. Methods of error correction in the quantum regime are presented, and their limitations assessed. A quantum channel can recover from arbitrary decoherence of x qubits if K bits of quantum information are encoded using n quantum bits, where K/n can be greater than 1-2 H(2x/n), but must be less than 1 - 2 H(x/n). This implies exponential reduction of decoherence with only a polynomial increase in the computing resources required. Therefore quantum computation can be made free of errors in the presence of physically realistic levels of decoherence. The methods also allow isolation of quantum communication from noise and evesdropping (quantum privacy amplification).},

All single-qubit Pauli errors on the ancillary qubits propagate to form exclusively correctable errors on the data qubits. The situation changes for error models with two-qubit Pauli errors. We compare the level-1 logical error rates under two noise models: the standard Pauli symmetric depolarizing error model and an anisotropic error model. The anisotropic model is motivated by control errors on two-qubit gates commonly applied to trapped ion qubits. We find that one ancillary qubit per syndrome measurement is sufficient for fault-tolerance for the anisotropic error, but is not sufficient for the standard depolarizing errors. We then show how to achieve fault tolerance for the standard depolarizing errors by adding flag qubits to check for errors on select ancilary qubits. Our results on this [[7, 1, 3]] code demonstrates how physically motivated noise models may simplify fault-tolerent protocols.},

We calculate a lower bound on the noise threshold for our local model using a detailed failure probability analysis. We obtain a threshold of 1.85 x 10{\textasciicircum}-5 for the local setting, where memory error rates are one-tenth of the failure rates of gates, measurement, and preparation steps. For the analogous nonlocal setting, we obtain a noise threshold of 3.61 x 10{\textasciicircum}-5.

These new constructions exploit structured sparse graphs, make essential use of simple and powerful coding techniques including concatenation, rotation and scrambling, and generate rich classes of codes with a wide range of lengths and rates. We derive the sufficient, and in some cases also the necessary, conditions for each construction to satisfy the general symplectic inner product (SIP) condition, and develop practical decoder algorithms for these codes. The resulting codes are the first classes of non-CSS quantum LDPC codes and non-CSS quantum convolutional codes rooted from classic binary codes (rather than codes in GF(4)), and some of them perform as well as or better than the existing quantum codes.},

	abstract = {Expander graphs have been recently proposed to construct efficient compressed sensing algorithms. In particular, it has been shown that any n-dimensional vector that is k-sparse can be fully recovered using O(klogn) measurements and only O(klogn) simple recovery iterations. In this paper, we improve upon this result by considering expander graphs with expansion coefficient beyond 3 / 4 and show that, with the same number of measurements, only O(k) recovery iterations are required, which is a significant improvement when n is large. In fact, full recovery can be accomplished by at most 2k very simple iterations. The number of iterations can be reduced arbitrarily close to k, and the recovery algorithm can be implemented very efficiently using a simple priority queue with total recovery time O(nlog(n/k))). We also show that by tolerating a small penalty on the number of measurements, and not on the number of recovery iterations, one can use the efficient construction of a family of expander graphs to come up with explicit measurement matrices for this method. We compare our result with other recently developed expander-graph-based methods and argue that it compares favorably both in terms of the number of required measurements and in terms of the time complexity and the simplicity of recovery. Finally, we will show how our analysis extends to give a robust algorithm that finds the position and sign of the k significant elements of an almost k-sparse signal and then, using very simple optimization techniques, finds a k-sparse signal which is close to the best k-term approximation of the original signal.},

We apply our formalism to the three-dimensional gauge color code (GCC) and show that its codeword space is equivalent to the Hilbert space of six copies of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ lattice gauge theory with \$1\$-form symmetries. We find that three different stabilizer Hamiltonians associated with the GCC correspond to distinct thermal symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in the presence of the stabilizer symmetries of the GCC. One of the considered Hamiltonians describes the Raussendorf-Bravyi-Harrington model, which is universal for measurement-based quantum computation at non-zero temperature. We also propose a general procedure of creating \$D\$-dimensional SPT Hamiltonians from \$(D+1)\$-dimensional CSS stabilizer Hamiltonians by exploiting a relation between gapped domain walls and transversal logical gates. As a result, we find an explicit two-dimensional realization of a non-trivial fracton SPT phase protected by fractal-like symmetries.},

Gauge transformations leave the encoded information unchanged; their effect is absorbed by virtual gauge qubits that do not carry useful information. We illustrate the construction by identifying a gauge symmetry in Shor's 9-qubit code that allows us to remove 4 of its 8 stabilizer generators, leading to a simpler decoding procedure and a wider class of logical operations without affecting its essential properties.

Our decoder is derived using relations among the stabilizers that preserve global conservation laws at the lattice boundary.

It boasts the smallest known syndrome extraction circuits and correspondingly largest thresholds. Defect-based logical encodings of a new variety called twists have made it possible to implement the full Clifford group without state distillation. Here we investigate a patch-based encoding involving a modified twist. In our modified formulation, the resulting codes, called triangle codes for the shape of their planar layout, have only weight-four checks and relatively simple syndrome extraction circuits that maintain a high, near surface-code-level threshold. They also use 25\% fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than the surface code. Moreover, benefiting from the twist, we can implement all Clifford gates by lattice surgery without the need for state distillation. By a surgical transformation to the surface code, we also develop a scheme of doing all Clifford gates on surface code patches in an atypical planar layout, though with less qubit efficiency than the triangle code. Finally, we remark that logical qubits encoded in triangle codes are naturally amenable to logical tomography, and the smallest triangle code can demonstrate high-pseudothreshold fault-tolerance to depolarizing noise using just 13 physical qubits.},

	abstract = {We optimize fault-tolerant quantum error correction to reduce the number of syndrome bit measurements. Speeding up error correction will also speed up an encoded quantum computation, and should reduce its effective error rate. We give both code-specific and general methods, using a variety of techniques and in a variety of settings. We design new quantum error-correcting codes specifically for efficient error correction, e.g., allowing single-shot error correction. For codes with multiple logical qubits, we give methods for combining error correction with partial logical measurements. There are tradeoffs in choosing a code and error-correction technique. While to date most work has concentrated on optimizing the syndrome-extraction procedure, we show that there are also substantial benefits to optimizing how the measured syndromes are chosen and used. As an example, we design single-shot measurement sequences for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with the 16-qubit extended Hamming code. Our scheme uses 10 syndrome bit measurements, compared to 40 measurements with the Shor scheme. We design single-shot logical measurements as well: any logical Z measurement can be made together with fault-tolerant error correction using only 11 measurements. For comparison, using the Shor scheme a basic implementation of such a non-destructive logical measurement uses 63 measurements. We also offer ten open problems, the solutions of which could lead to substantial improvements of fault-tolerant error correction.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05180},
	abstract = {Extensive quantum error correction is necessary in order to perform a useful computation on a noisy quantum computer. Moreover, quantum error correction must be implemented based on imperfect parity check measurements that may return incorrect outcomes or inject additional faults into the qubits. To achieve fault-tolerant error correction, Shor proposed to repeat the sequence of parity check measurements until the same outcome is observed sufficiently many times. Then, one can use this information to perform error correction. A basic implementation of this fault tolerance strategy requires \${\textbackslash}Omega(r d{\textasciicircum}2)\$ parity check measurements for a distance-d code defined by r parity checks. For some specific highly structured quantum codes, Bombin has shown that single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction is possible using only r measurements. In this work, we demonstrate that fault-tolerant quantum error correction can be achieved using \$O(d {\textbackslash}log(d))\$ measurements for any code with distance \$d {\textbackslash}geq {\textbackslash}Omega(n{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha)\$ for some constant \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textgreater} 0\$. Moreover, we prove the existence of a sub-single-shot fault-tolerant quantum error correction scheme using fewer than r measurements. In some cases, the number of parity check measurements required for fault-tolerant quantum error correction is exponentially smaller than the number of parity checks defining the code.},

In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z\_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.},

One of the main difficulties of realizing quantum computation is that decoherence tends to destroy the information in a superposition of states in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit with t gates could tolerate O(1/t) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate. We show, for any quantum computation with t gates, how to build a polynomial size quantum circuit that can tolerate O(1/(log t){\textasciicircum}c) amounts of inaccuracy and decoherence per gate, for some constant c. We do this by showing how to compute using quantum error correcting codes. These codes were previously known to provide resistance to errors while storing and transmitting quantum data.},

Remarkably, this honeycomb code assembles weight-six parity checks using only two-local measurements. The sparse connectivity and two-local measurements are desirable features for certain hardware, while the weight-six parity checks enable robust performance in the circuit model. In this work, we quantify the robustness of logical qubits preserved by the honeycomb code using a correlated minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder. Using Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the honeycomb code's threshold in different error models, and project how efficiently it can reach the "teraquop regime" where trillions of quantum logical operations can be executed reliably. We perform the same estimates for the rotated surface code, and find a threshold of \$0.2{\textbackslash}\%-0.3{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the honeycomb code compared to a threshold of \$0.5{\textbackslash}\%-0.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ for the surface code in a controlled-not circuit model. In a circuit model with native two-body measurements, the honeycomb code achieves a threshold of \$1.5{\textbackslash}\% {\textless} p {\textless}2.0{\textbackslash}\%\$, where \$p\$ is the collective error rate of the two-body measurement gate - including both measurement and correlated data depolarization error processes. With such gates at a physical error rate of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, we project that the honeycomb code can reach the teraquop regime with only \$600\$ physical qubits.},

Finally, ACES is extremely scalable: we demonstrate with numerical simulations that it simultaneously and precisely estimates all the Pauli error rates on every gate and measurement in a 100 qubit quantum device using fewer than 20 relatively shallow Clifford circuits and an experimentally feasible number of samples.

	abstract = {The error rates of quantum devices are orders of magnitude higher than what is needed to run most quantum applications. To close this gap, Quantum Error Correction (QEC) encodes logical qubits and distributes information using several physical qubits. By periodically executing a syndrome extraction circuit on the logical qubits, information about errors (called syndrome) is extracted while running programs. A decoder uses these syndromes to identify and correct errors in real time, which is required to use feedback implemented in quantum algorithms. Unfortunately, software decoders are slow and hardware decoders are fast but less accurate. Thus, almost all QEC studies so far have relied on offline decoding. To enable real-time decoding in near-term QEC, we propose LILLIPUT-- a Lightweight Low Latency Look-Up Table decoder. LILLIPUT consists of two parts-- First, it translates syndromes into error detection events that index into a Look-Up Table (LUT) whose entry provides the error information in real-time. Second, it programs the LUTs with error assignments for all possible error events by running a software decoder offline. LILLIPUT tolerates an error on any operation in the quantum hardware, including gates and measurement, and the number of tolerated errors grows with the size of the code. It needs {\textless}7\% logic on off-the-shelf FPGAs that allows it to be easily integrated alongside the control and readout circuits in existing systems. LILLIPUT incurs a latency of few nanoseconds and enables real-time decoding. We also propose Compressed LUTs (CLUTs) to reduce the memory needed by LILLIPUT. By exploiting the fact that not all error events are equally likely and only storing data for the most probable error events, CLUTs reduce the memory needed by up-to 107x (from 148 MB to 1.38 MB) without degrading accuracy.},

One important remaining roadblock for large-scale quantum information processing in such systems is associated with the finite lifetime of atomic Rydberg states during entangling operations. Because such Rydberg state decay errors can result in many possible channels of leakage out of the computational subspace as well as correlated errors, they cannot be addressed directly through traditional methods of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the effects of these sources of errors on a neutral-atom quantum computer and propose hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant quantum computation schemes that mitigate them. By using the specific structure of the error model, the multi-level nature of atoms, and dipole selection rules, we find that the resource cost for fault-tolerant quantum computation can be significantly reduced compared to existing, general-purpose schemes, even when these novel types of errors are accounted for. We illustrate the experimental feasibility of our protocols through concrete examples with qubits encoded in \${\textasciicircum}\{87\}\$Rb, \${\textasciicircum}\{85\}\$Rb, or \${\textasciicircum}\{87\}\$Sr atoms.

We show that while conceptually different, certain results from the theory of trellis decoding for classical linear block codes have quantum analogies.

The decoder works for any stabilizer code \$S\$ and separates into two parts: an expensive, one-time, offline computation which builds a compact, graphical representation of the normalizer of the code, \$S{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}perp\$, and a quick, parallel, online query of the resulting vertices using the Viterbi algorithm. Mathematical results about the trellises are obtained for prime-dimension qudit codes . We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach numerically by natively decoding the rotated surface code and the 4.8.8/6.6.6 color code families on qubits for moderate distances without any concept of homology. Code capacity thresholds for all three families are found to be between 10-11{\textbackslash}\% for distances up to 17-21 under a \$Z\$-only noise model. Computational limitations and open problems are discussed. We additionally use the developed framework to promote a new, quantitative metric describing the fundamental difficulty of decoding a given stabilizer code. We apply this to show that, for example, the color code families are more difficult to decode than the rotated surface code family. We also investigate CSS codes under this framework and use this metric to quantitatively discuss the computational savings of decoding \$X\$- and \$Z\$-errors independently.},

The classification uses, at its center, a reinterpretation of the tableau representation of stabilizer gates to give circuit decompositions, from which elementary generators can easily be extracted. There are a total of 57 different stabilizer classes generated in this way, 30 of which arise from the single-qubit subgroups of the Clifford group. At a high level, the remaining classes are arranged according to the bases they preserve. For instance, the CNOT gate preserves the X and Z bases because it maps X-basis elements to X-basis elements and Z-basis elements to Z-basis elements. The remaining classes are characterized by more subtle tableau invariants; for instance, the T\_4 and phase gate generate a proper subclass of Z-preserving gates.},

	abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit -- that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a "canonical form" that requires at most O(n{\textasciicircum}2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02464},
	abstract = {We study the performance of classical and quantum machine learning (ML) models in predicting outcomes of physical experiments. The experiments depend on an input parameter \$x\$ and involve execution of a (possibly unknown) quantum process \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$. Our figure of merit is the number of runs of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ required to achieve a desired prediction performance. We consider classical ML models that perform a measurement and record the classical outcome after each run of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$, and quantum ML models that can access \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ coherently to acquire quantum data; the classical or quantum data is then used to predict outcomes of future experiments. We prove that for any input distribution \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{D\}(x)\$, a classical ML model can provide accurate predictions on average by accessing \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$ a number of times comparable to the optimal quantum ML model. In contrast, for achieving accurate prediction on all inputs, we prove that exponential quantum advantage is possible. For example, to predict expectations of all Pauli observables in an \$n\$-qubit system \${\textbackslash}rho\$, classical ML models require \$2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}Omega(n)\}\$ copies of \${\textbackslash}rho\$, but we present a quantum ML model using only \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(n)\$ copies. Our results clarify where quantum advantage is possible and highlight the potential for classical ML models to address challenging quantum problems in physics and chemistry.},

We then show that the CHSH Bell inequalities can be visualized as circles and cylinders in the same diagram. This allows us to give a geometric proof of yet another result of the Horodeckies, which optimizes the violation of the CHSH Bell inequality. Finally, we give numerical evidence that, remarkably, allowing Alice and Bob to use three rather than two measurements each, does not help them to distinguish any new entangled SLOCC equivalence class beyond the CHSH class.},

The quantum volume is linked to system error rates, and is empirically reduced by uncontrolled interactions within the system. It quantifies the largest random circuit of equal width and depth that the computer successfully implements. Quantum computing systems with high-fidelity operations, high connectivity, large calibrated gate sets, and circuit rewriting toolchains are expected to have higher quantum volumes.

We derive the invariants for local transformations, and connect these local invariants to the coordinates of the 3-Torus. Since different points on the 3-Torus may correspond to the same local equivalence class, we use the Weyl group theory to reduce the symmetry. We show that the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates are in one-to-one correspondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base. We then study the properties of perfect entanglers, that is, the two-qubit operations that can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable states. We provide criteria to determine whether a given two-qubit gate is a perfect entangler and establish a geometric description of perfect entanglers by making use of the tetrahedral representation of non-local gates. We find that exactly half the non-local gates are perfect entanglers. We also investigate the non-local operations generated by a given Hamiltonian. We first study the gates that can be directly generated by a Hamiltonian. Then we explicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains at most three non-local gates generated by a two-body interaction Hamiltonian, together with at most four local gates generated by single qubit terms. We prove that such a quantum circuit can simulate any arbitrary two-qubit gate exactly, and hence it provides an efficient implementation of universal quantum computation and simulation.},
