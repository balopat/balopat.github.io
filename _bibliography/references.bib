	abstract = {An n-qubit quantum circuit performs a unitary operation on an exponentially large, 2n-dimensional, Hilbert space, which is a major source of quantum speed-ups. We develop a new “Quantum singular value transformation” algorithm that can directly harness the advantages of exponential dimensionality by applying polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary operator. The transformations are realized by quantum circuits with a very simple structure - typically using only a constant number of ancilla qubits - leading to optimal algorithms with appealing constant factors. We show that our framework allows describing many quantum algorithms on a high level, and enables remarkably concise proofs for many prominent quantum algorithms, ranging from optimal Hamiltonian simulation to various quantum machine learning applications. We also devise a new singular vector transformation algorithm, describe how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum, and show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. Finally, we also prove a quantum lower bound on spectral transformations.},
